Takes the release version from the invocation, or reads it from the zodl-production target, writes the release entry into every whatsNew*.json file (one per language) — prepending it, or replacing the existing entry if that version is already there — and prints the App Store changelog text for each language. Manual only — invoke with /update-whatsnew and paste the multi-language changelog.

# Update What's New + App Store changelog

Turn a freeform, multi-language release changelog into two things:

1. **Updated `whatsNew*.json` files** — one file per language, each carrying the
   release entry at the top of its `releases` array.
2. **App Store changelog text** — one ready-to-paste block per language, printed
   in the chat.

You do the part that needs judgment: reading the messy, multi-language input and
splitting it into clean structured sections. A bundled script
(`scripts/whatsnew.py`) does the mechanical part — writing the JSON and rendering
the App Store text — so the file edit is always valid JSON and a minimal,
review-friendly diff (other releases are never reformatted).

**Re-running for the same version is expected and safe.** The changelog for a
release in flight often gets amended — a bullet added, wording tweaked. If the
version already has an entry, the script **replaces it in place** rather than
refusing or adding a duplicate, so you can just re-run the command with the full
corrected changelog and the entry ends up matching exactly what you pasted.

This skill is manual only. Run it when a release is being cut.

## The input

The changelog arrives as the command argument (substituted below) or in the
user's message:

ARGUMENTS: $ARGUMENTS

The argument may open with the release version (`X.Y.Z`) before the first
language block; step 1 says how it is used. The changelog itself is one block
per language. Each block starts with a language name
(`English`, `Español`, …) and contains sections — a short header line ending in
`:` (`Added:`, `Changed:`, `Fixed:`, `Removed:`, and their localized forms like
`Añadido:`, `Cambiado:`, `Corregido:`) followed by one or more items.

The shape is **not** rigid. Expect variation between releases: blank lines
between items, an optional leading `-`, `*`, `•`, or `–` on each item, extra
spacing. Read it for meaning rather than matching an exact pattern. If the
changelog isn't in the argument or the message, ask the user to paste it.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine the release version

A version named in the invocation wins: a leading `X.Y.Z` before the changelog
(`/update-whatsnew 3.11.0 …`), or one stated in the user's message, is the
release version exactly as given.

Only when no version was named, read `MARKETING_VERSION` from the
**zodl-production** target (this is what ships to the App Store). It takes
~20s — that's normal:

```bash
xcodebuild -project secant.xcodeproj -target zodl-production \
  -showBuildSettings -configuration Release-AppStore 2>/dev/null \
  | awk -F' = ' '/ MARKETING_VERSION /{print $2; exit}'
```

Fallback if `xcodebuild` is unavailable (every target is kept on the same
version, so this is reliable in practice, just not target-specific):

```bash
grep -m1 'MARKETING_VERSION' secant.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj | sed 's/.*= *//; s/;.*//'
```

A checkout-derived version needs a cross-check: during a release cycle only
`candidate/X.Y.Z` carries the new version, so every other checkout — `main`
included — still reads the **previous** release. On a `candidate/X.Y.Z` or
`release/X.Y.Z` branch (`git branch --show-current`), the version read must
equal the version in the branch name — stop and report a mismatch. On any
other checkout the version cannot be confirmed here; step 4's dry-run is the
tripwire.

### 2. Determine date and timestamp — once, shared by all languages

```bash
date +%d-%m-%Y   # e.g. 23-06-2026  (DD-MM-YYYY — matches recent entries)
date +%s         # e.g. 1782211565  (Unix epoch seconds)
```

Use the **same** version, date, and timestamp for every language — it's one
release.

### 3. Parse the changelog into one payload per language

For each language block, build a payload JSON file (write it to a temp path such
as `/tmp/whatsnew-<lang>.json` — using the file write tool avoids shell-escaping
problems with quotes, apostrophes, and accents):

```json
{
  "version": "<from step 1>",
  "date": "<from step 2>",
  "timestamp": <from step 2>,
  "sections": [
    { "title": "Added:", "bulletpoints": ["First item.", "Second item."] },
    { "title": "Changed:", "bulletpoints": ["..."] }
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- **Keep the section title verbatim**, including the trailing colon, in that
  language (`Added:`, `Añadido:`, …). Never translate — the input is already
  localized.
- **Preserve section order** as given.
- **One clean string per item.** Strip a leading bullet marker (`-`, `*`, `•`,
  `–`) and surrounding whitespace. Items are normally separated by blank lines.
- **The payload is the whole entry.** On a re-run the script replaces the
  existing entry outright, so each payload must contain *every* section and item
  that release should show — not just the parts that changed since the last run.
  Build it from the changelog the user pasted, as pasted.
- Map each language to its file (see the table below). If a block has no
  language header and there's only one block, ask the user which language it is
  rather than guessing.

### 4. Pre-flight — dry-run every target file

Before touching anything, dry-run each file so the whole operation is atomic:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/update-whatsnew/scripts/whatsnew.py add \
  --file <whatsNew file> --payload <temp payload> --dry-run
```

Read what each dry-run reports:

- **`would add`** — the version is new; it gets prepended.
- **`would replace`** — the version already has an entry and it will be
  overwritten in place. When the version was named in the invocation, or was
  read on the release's own candidate branch, this is normal for an amended
  changelog; just carry on. The entry keeps its original `date`/`timestamp` so
  an amendment doesn't look like a re-release. **Mention the replacement to the
  user** when you report, and if they want the date bumped to today, re-run
  that file with `--refresh-date`. But when the version was derived from a
  checkout that is **not** the release's candidate branch, an existing entry
  is the stale-checkout signature — a freshly cut release never already has
  one, so this is almost certainly the previous release's version about to be
  clobbered with the new copy. **Stop and ask the user to confirm the
  version** before writing anything.
- **`Unchanged`** — the on-disk entry already matches the payload byte for byte;
  nothing will be written. Expected when re-running with an unedited changelog.
- **A language with no file yet** is a new language. Do **not** guess the
  filename. Ask the user to confirm the name (suggest `whatsNew_<code>.json`
  with the ISO 639-1 code, e.g. German → `whatsNew_de.json`), then plan to pass
  `--create` for that file in step 5.
- **Exit 2** is a real error (bad payload, unparseable file, missing file without
  `--create`). Stop, show the user, and change nothing — not this file and not
  the others.

Only continue once every dry-run is OK.

### 5. Apply — write the entries

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/update-whatsnew/scripts/whatsnew.py add \
  --file <whatsNew file> --payload <temp payload>
```

Add `--create` **only** for the new-language file the user confirmed in step 4.
Never hand-edit the JSON to patch up a replace — re-run the script with a
corrected payload instead, so both languages stay consistent.

### 6. Produce the App Store text

For each language:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/update-whatsnew/scripts/whatsnew.py appstore \
  --payload <temp payload>
```

Present each language's output in its own labeled fenced code block so the user
can copy each one straight into App Store Connect.

### 7. Report

Summarize: the version, date, timestamp, whether each file was **added to or
replaced**, and which files changed. Show the diff
(`git diff -- secant/Resources/WhatsNew/`) so the user can confirm only the
intended entry moved.

On a replace the diff shows just the lines that actually differ — an unchanged
line re-renders identically — so a small diff is the expected, correct outcome,
not a sign that something was skipped. If a section the user pasted produces no
diff line, it was already on disk and identical; say so rather than re-editing.

## Language → file mapping

| Language block | File |
|----------------|------|
| English | `secant/Resources/WhatsNew/whatsNew.json` |
| Español / Spanish | `secant/Resources/WhatsNew/whatsNew_es.json` |
| Any other language | `secant/Resources/WhatsNew/whatsNew_<ISO 639-1>.json` — **confirm the name with the user, then `--create`** |

English is the only language with no suffix. Every other language uses a
`_<code>` suffix.

## Invariants (why the script exists)

- **Newest entry on top; every *other* release is left alone.** A new version is
  spliced in after the `"releases": [` line and a replaced one is spliced over
  its own character span, so in both cases the surrounding entries stay
  byte-for-byte identical — a release shows up as a small, obvious diff instead
  of a whole-file reformat.
- **Re-running is idempotent.** Same payload twice = no second entry, and no
  write at all when nothing changed.
- **A replace never relocates an entry.** It is rewritten where it sits; if it
  wasn't the newest, the script says so in its output.
- **Valid JSON, correct formatting, accents preserved** (8-space-indented entry,
  `ensure_ascii=False`). The script validates the result before writing.
- **One release = one shared version/date/timestamp across all languages** — and
  a replaced entry keeps the date/timestamp it was first written with unless
  `--refresh-date` says otherwise.
- Don't hand-edit the JSON files for this — let the script do it so every
  release is consistent.

## The helper script

`scripts/whatsnew.py` (Python 3, standard library only):

- `add --file F --payload P [--create] [--refresh-date] [--dry-run]` — write the
  release in `P` into `F`: prepended if that version is new, **replaced in place
  if it already exists**, and skipped entirely if the on-disk entry already
  matches. `--create` makes a fresh `{ "releases": [] }` file for a new language.
  `--refresh-date` makes a replace adopt the payload's `date`/`timestamp` instead
  of keeping the existing entry's. `--dry-run` validates and reports which of
  add / replace / unchanged would happen, without writing. Exit **2** = error,
  nothing written.
- `appstore --payload P` — print the App Store changelog text for `P`.

Payload schema is shown in step 3; `date`/`timestamp` default to today/now if
omitted, but pass them explicitly so all languages match.
