## Asking Questions

Questions are welcome! We encourage you to ask questions through GitHub issues.
Before doing so, please check that the project issues database doesn't already
include an answer to your question. Then open a new Issue and use the "Question"
label.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you have discovered an issue with this code that could present a security hazard or wish to discuss a sensitive issue with our security team, please contact security@z.cash [security.asc](https://z.cash/gpg-pubkeys/security.asc). Key fingerprint = AF85 0445 546C 18B7 86F9 2C62 88FB 8B86 D8B5 A68C

## Reporting Non Security Issues

A great way to contribute to the project
is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem.
We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too."
Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please include the following:

* The version of Xcode you're using
* The version of iOS or macOS you're targeting
* The full output of any stack trace or compiler error
* A code snippet that reproduces the described behavior, if applicable
* Any other details that would be useful in understanding the problem

This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.

## Pull Requests

We **love** pull requests! 

All contributions _will_ be licensed under the MIT license.

Code/comments should adhere to the following rules:

* Every Pull request must have an Issue associated to it. PRs with not 
associated with an Issue will be closed
* Code build and Code Lint must pass.
* Names should be descriptive and concise.
* Although they are not mandatory, PRs that include significant testing will be
prioritized.
* All enhancements and bug fixes need to be documented in the CHANGELOG.
* When writing comments, use properly constructed sentences, including
  punctuation.
* When documenting APIs and/or source code, don't make assumptions or make
  implications about race, gender, religion, political orientation or anything
  else that isn't relevant to the project.
* Remember that source code usually gets written once and read often: ensure
  the reader doesn't have to make guesses. Make sure that the purpose and inner
  logic are either obvious to a reasonably skilled professional, or add a
  comment that explains it.
