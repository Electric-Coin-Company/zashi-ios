### Fixed

- Content of Zashi is hidden in system's app switcher.

## 0.2.0 build 15 (2024-01-31)

### Fixed
- Shileding of transparent funds.

## 0.2.0 build 14 (2024-01-30)

### Updated
- SDK 2.0.7 adopted with the performance optimizations on the rust side.

## 0.2.0 build 13 (2024-01-28)

### Added
- Share QR code of addresses via system share dialog.

### Fixed
- `Keys Missing` error dialog was sometimes triggered as a false positive due to system overload and keychain API unresponsivity in expected time. Retry logic was implemented to pass this state. Also the app always lands users to the Account tab instead of lock them on a splash screen with no options to solve this state.

## 0.2.0 build 12 (2024-01-20)

### Added
- The exported logs also show the shielded balances (total & verified) for every finished sync metric.
- Synchronization in the background. When the iPhone is connected to the power and wifi, the background task will try to synchronize randomly between 3-4am.
- Restore of the wallet is now indiated in the UI throughout the application.
- A hint box that elucidates transparent funds and shielding on the Balances tab.

### Fixed

## 0.2.0 build 11 (2023-12-13)

### Added
- Option to export SDK and wallet logs in `Export private data` screen.

### Changed
- The background of Onboarding and some of the Settings screen has been updated to show a subtle texture of a grid pattern.
- The sapling address + QR code has been restored on the Receive tab (for testnet only.)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that caused spends to appear to be stuck.
- The confirmation screen has been altered such that the message bubble is rendered only when the message is non-empty. 

## 0.2.0 build 10 (2023-11-30)

### Changed
- The way how the balances (zatoshi amounts/values) are represented has been updated accoridng to the latest requirements. In general any zatoshi value has 2 major states, expanded or abbreviated. Trailing zeroes are trimmed when expanded.
- The `Balances` screen has been redesigned: new progress bar with the status of the synchronization, all balances available. Penging fields are disabled for now and show only zeroes until support from the SDK is implemented.
- When the send button is tapped, the sending title + spinner is shown instead of just the spinner. Also, when the send is done, and redirect to the Account page is done, the sending transaction is already populated in the list. The lag between it was presented has been fixed.

### Removed
- [testnet only] The sapling address and the QR of it has been removed from the receive screen. The only meaningful options are the UA and the transparent addresses. 

### Added
- Confirmation screen when sending funds. The initial screen is about filling in the address, amount and message (optional). The butoon `review` leads to a brand new screen where the summary of the transaction is presented. The send is confirmed by tapping the send button. Going back to update send data is possible via `go back` button.

## 0.2.0 build 9 (2023-11-14)

### Changed
- Send (tab) redesigned: All the input fields are at the same screen. The screen is scrollable so it's usable on every possible iPhone.  
- Complete redesign of transactions on the Account tab. Expandable transactions show details of it, including options to copy transaction IDs as well as addresses. 

### Added
- The concept of read/unread transactions with the message (memo) implemented. The color of the icon of received transaction that holds message and hasn't been read yet is yellow. Once the transaction is expanded, the icon's color flips to the black and the state is persisted.

## 0.2.0 build 6 (2023-11-01)

### Added
- Option to export private data: brand new screen accessible via Settings, where once consent acknowledged, a user can export a database of data. Important note: the data are sensitive because it holds some information about user's transactions and history but spending keys are not exported so lost of funds is not possible. 

## 0.2.0 build 5 (2023-10-26)

### Changed
- Settings screen has been redesigned and options on the screen changed. 
- Truncation of the balances changed from 8 floating points to the 3 only.
- Restore from the seed flow and UI updated.

### Changed
- Zashi design buttons
- Splash screen: new animated screen with the logo + HI text.
- Security warning screen UI updated.
- State and progress of the synchronizer moved from the Home screen to the balance breakdown screen.
