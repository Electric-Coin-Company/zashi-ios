# Changelog
All notable changes to this application will be documented in this file.

This changelog is for the people who use ZODL: it records user-visible changes
— what is different, where you will meet it, and what to do about it. Developer
tooling, CI, tests, and internal refactors are deliberately not listed.

## [Unreleased]

## [3.11.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- [MOB-1501] Swap and Pay now offer DASH, Bitcoin Cash, and ZEC on Solana and NEAR as assets you can swap to or pay with, and Dash and Bitcoin Cash can be chosen as the chain when saving a swap address in the Address Book.

### Changed
- [MOB-1831] Automatic server selection no longer switches servers for marginal gains. The app switches only when the benchmark shows the new server is meaningfully faster than the current one — at least 200 ms and at least 25% faster — or when the current server fails its health checks. Practically equal servers no longer cause needless sync restarts.

### Fixed
- [MOB-1831] Opening Send immediately after launching ZODL now shows the saved spendable balance while automatic server selection completes.
- The Keystone hardware wallet connection screen now refers to Zodl instead of Zashi in the note that a previously connected wallet needs to sync to find its transaction history.

## [3.10.3] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- [MOB-1749] When a wallet that already holds Ironwood funds still has a small spendable amount of ZEC sitting in the Orchard pool — less than 0.01 ZEC but more than 0.0001 ZEC, typically after restoring a wallet that was migrated on another device or after moving funds yourself — the home screen shows a "… ZEC left in Orchard" banner once the wallet is fully synced (never over a figure that has not been verified). The banner ranks directly below the migration banners themselves — only connectivity and sync-error alerts and an actual migration outrank it — and it retires for good after two taps (lock or migrate), so the reminders it briefly covers return; an outstanding shielding reminder also no longer hides the reminders ranked below it. Tapping More opens a screen that shows what is in Ironwood, what is left in Orchard, what is still pending, and — when an earlier visit locked part of it — what is already locked, and lets you lock the leftover balance (recommended: moving an amount that specific could link your Ironwood funds back to your Orchard history) or migrate it anyway. Migrating anyway from an unlocked balance moves only the spendable leftover and never touches an amount you locked before; on a locked balance the same button is the way back — it unlocks the funds and moves them after all. A completed migration's screen always reports that run's own leftover, even when an earlier amount is still locked, and leaving the flow with a back-swipe is immediate. A migration that is still running, or a Migration Complete screen you have not reviewed yet, always takes precedence, and the banner disappears by itself once the balance is locked or migrated.
- [MOB-1753] The vote submission screen now explains that submitting can take a few minutes and that wallets with more voting weight take longer to process.
- [Internal] On the Send screen, in internal and testnet builds only, the Amount field now has a "Max" button that fills in the maximum amount you can send, net of the network fee — computed for the exact payment being set up, including its memo. The button is available only with a spendable balance and a valid recipient address, a result for an outdated address is discarded, and a toast tells you when the amount could not be fetched.
- [Internal] On the Swap and Pay screens, in internal and testnet builds only, the amount field now has a "Max" button too. On Swap it fills in the largest amount of ZEC you can swap, net of the network fee (or its value in USD when you have switched the field to USD); on Pay it fills in what that amount is worth in the token you are paying with, and updates the accompanying USD value alongside it. The button is unavailable while your balance is still confirming or empty, or while a quote is being fetched, and a toast tells you when the amount could not be fetched or converted.

### Changed
- The paste-seed shortcut on the Secret Recovery Phrase screen (long-press the title) now works in internal and testnet builds — including TestFlight — instead of debug builds only. It stays excluded from the App Store build.

### Fixed
- [MOB-1800] Tapping Confirm when submitting a vote now responds immediately: the button disables and shows a spinner the instant it is tapped, extra taps can no longer interrupt and restart a submission already underway, and the screen no longer briefly re-enables mid-submission while the authorization work hands over. Cancelling the Face ID prompt cleanly returns the Confirm button.
- [MOB-1803] Opening the Receive screen (and requesting a swap quote) no longer freezes for seconds while the wallet is catching up on sync. A fresh rotated address is prepared ahead of time so the screen opens instantly; in the rare case none is ready yet, the screen opens with a brief loading placeholder instead of blocking. Every visit still gets its own never-shown-before address.
- [MOB-1800] Submitting coinholder-poll votes is significantly faster: preparing the vote proofs no longer runs at background priority (which pinned it to the efficiency cores), so the "Authorizing" step no longer stalls for minutes on the proving-key preparation.
- [MOB-1800] Retrying a coinholder-poll submission no longer stalls up to 90 seconds per voting bundle re-checking an authorization from an interrupted earlier attempt — it now checks once and immediately re-authorizes.
- [Ironwood] Opening a poll no longer deletes and recreates it when its setup was interrupted. The round is reused where it already exists, so nothing a poll has accumulated can be discarded by opening it.
- [MOB-1810] The polls list opens without waiting for vote-server health checks; checks now run in the background when entering a poll, and recovering share deliveries steer around servers that keep failing.
- [MOB-1810] Fixed a crash when the voting service configuration lists the same server URL twice; such configurations are now rejected with a clear error.
- [MOB-1798] Coinholder Polling now correctly reads delegation positions from older vote-server responses.
- [MOB-1801] Coinholder Polling no longer becomes unavailable when the primary voting configuration service is unreachable or blocked (for example on networks that filter crypto-related domains). The app now verifies the same pinned configuration from a second, independent mirror and walks the configuration's own mirror list the same way, and configuration requests give up after 15 seconds instead of two minutes, so a dead route fails over quickly instead of locking you out of voting.
- [MOB-1801] Coinholder Polling no longer becomes unavailable when the primary voting configuration service is unreachable or blocked (for example on networks that filter crypto-related domains). The app now verifies the same pinned configuration from a second, independent mirror and walks the configuration's own mirror list the same way, and configuration requests give up after 15 seconds instead of two minutes, so a dead route fails over quickly instead of locking you out of voting. The Default source in the voting configuration settings now also shows the mirror it may contact.
- [MOB-1749] The "… ZEC left in Orchard" banner now disappears as soon as "Migrate anyway" has sent the migration transaction, instead of lingering on the home screen — where tapping More no longer opened the screen for the leftover balance but the first screen of a fresh migration. The banner now learns about the sent transaction before you can get back to the home screen.
- [MOB-1802] Resuming an interrupted Keystone voting session no longer destroys local delegation data, so restarts pick up where signing left off instead of failing with a voting backend error; stale saved signatures are always re-verified against the stored signing data instead of trusted blindly, and a signature that provably no longer matches is discarded so its bundle is rebuilt and re-signed instead of staying stuck. Voting errors — including a failed resume — now show an actionable message instead of raw database internals.
- [MOB-1755] Shielding a transparent deposit no longer leaves a second "Shield 0.000 ZEC" banner behind it. The banner could reappear for the funds that had just been shielded — showing a zero amount — and tapping it ended on a "Shielding Error" alert, because there was nothing left to shield. The amount the banner offers is now always the balance your wallet actually reports, so it can no longer show one figure while the truth is another, and the offer is withdrawn the moment the shielding succeeds. Should shielding ever be attempted with nothing to shield, ZODL now says so plainly instead of showing an error code and offering to file a report.
- [MOB-1755] "Remind me later" on the shielding banner works again. The button had been lost in an earlier restructuring, so putting the banner off never actually stored a reminder — the banner could return immediately. The sheet now offers the same phased snooze as the backup reminder ("Remind me in 2 days", then 2 weeks, then a month), every route that could re-show the banner honours it, and while a reminder is pending the banner slot is handed to the next suggestion instead of staying empty.
- [MOB-1755] A transparent deposit that arrives while ZODL is still syncing now produces the shielding offer as soon as the sync completes — previously the offer could be silently lost until the next app launch. When a shielding offer stops being valid just as it is about to appear, the banner now moves on to the next suggestion instead of showing nothing, and a completed shield no longer knocks down an unrelated banner that happened to be on screen.
- [MOB-1755] The shielding suggestion no longer disappears for the whole session when the syncing or error banner takes its place — it returns once the wallet is back up to date. A banner being retracted at the exact moment another one is being shown can no longer knock down the new banner, the sync-error banner included, and a banner that was just retracted can no longer briefly reappear as an empty shell.
- [MOB-1755] Switching accounts right when ZODL was mid-check for a shielding offer could leave the banner showing a balance left over from the account you switched away from. The check now always applies to whichever account is currently selected.
- [MOB-1802] Keystone voting signing QR is now drawn on a white plate like the send-flow QR, so Keystone devices can scan it in dark mode.

## [3.10.2] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- [Ironwood] Before opening the voting database, ZODL now preserves a copy of it under `voting_recovery`. If an earlier version already discarded a poll's delegation, that copy keeps what is needed to restore it later — even if you upgrade long after the poll was affected. It is taken only once, so the earliest and most complete copy is the one kept; it is included in device backups so it survives a migration, and is removed when the wallet is reset.

### Fixed
- Coinholder Polling now recovers an ambiguously submitted delegation or vote by checking its exact transaction hash, and reopening a poll no longer discards persisted delegation setup needed to retry safely.

## [3.10.0] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- [MOB-1678] Coinholder Polling now loads its trusted configuration through the resilient voting config gateway, so a GitHub outage no longer blocks configuration loading while the mirrored copy is available.
- [Ironwood] Coinholder Polling is available again and reappears in Settings, now that voting runs on the Ironwood network upgrade. Nothing was deleted while it was away — any rounds you had already taken part in are still there.

## [3.9.5] - 2026-08-18

## [3.9.4] - 2026-08-17

## [3.9.3] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- [Ironwood] Warn before confirming a send that has to spend Orchard funds: the confirmation screen now shows a sheet recommending migration first, with the option to continue or cancel.

## [3.9.2] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- The hidden database debug screen (Settings → What's New → long-press the logo) now accepts a special "print_notifs" query that lists the migration reminder notifications currently scheduled on the device — their identifiers, fire times and accounts — instead of running SQL.

### Fixed
- [MOB-1630] The migration banner no longer offers a migration when the account's Orchard balance is below 0.01 ZEC/TAZ — the smallest amount a migration can move. Such an offer could never be fulfilled: tapping it always ended on a failure screen, and the "Migration Required" banner never went away.
- [MOB-1581] A sent transaction no longer stays stuck showing "Sending…" after it has confirmed. ZODL no longer misses the confirmation signal when it arrives alongside other synchronizer events, keeps refreshing the transaction list after the app returns from the background (previously a single background/foreground cycle silently stopped the automatic refresh until the app was relaunched), and additionally re-checks pending transactions every 30 seconds as a safety net.
- [MOB-1670] "Split Balance" rows in the migration plan and Migration Progress timelines now always show the coins-swap icon instead of sometimes borrowing a transfer's step number. A split row could previously appear as "1" — while its transaction was confirming, once its window had passed, or for the second and later rows of a balance that splits in several steps — which read as though it were the first transfer rather than the preparation step that comes before them.
- [MOB-1670] The connecting line below the "Split Balance" row on the Confirm Transfer Plan screen is no longer drawn in black while the split is still waiting to run. The dark line marks the transfer that is currently up, so on a plan you had not started yet it made the split look already underway; every step now reads as the same neutral gray until something actually sends.

## [3.9.1] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- [MOB-1466] Advanced Settings now offers "Restart Migration" while a migration is running. It shows how much has already migrated and how much is left, warns that restarting cancels the current plan for good, and asks for a separate confirmation before anything happens. Transfers that already went out are untouched — they stay migrated — and once the plan is cancelled you set up a new one for the remaining balance the same way you did the first time.
- [MOB-1466] With a privacy migration in progress, keeping the app open now advances the migration automatically — transfers send on schedule without reopening the app.

### Changed
- [MOB-1466] Starting a migration now holds you on a "Scheduling…" screen while the schedule is confirmed and the first step is prepared, instead of leaving you on the plan under a spinning button for up to half a minute. The summary fills in with your real numbers the moment it is ready.
- [MOB-1466] The migration split details sheet now scrolls when a split has more than five steps, so long splits stay readable and the sheet's total and "Got it" button stay reachable. Shorter splits are unchanged.
- [MOB-1466] "Restart Migration" appears in Advanced Settings only while a migration is actually in progress, and no longer lingers once one has finished.
- [MOB-1466] After restarting a migration, the home screen banner no longer keeps counting the cancelled run — it clears and offers the migration again for your remaining balance.
- [MOB-1496] The balance-splitting transactions a migration prepares now go out in the same app session that prepares them, instead of waiting for the next 30-second check to pick them up. Preparing one and sending it are a single step by design, so a run's setup phase no longer stalls a step behind itself. Each one is also reported back to the migration engine as sent, so it is never announced to the network a second time from a later check.
- [MOB-1496] Scheduled migration transfers are no longer delayed by a fixed waiting period after a sync. The app used to refuse to send for ten minutes (three on testnet) after every completed sync, and the SDK refused to sync for ten minutes after every migration broadcast, so a wallet could sit open doing nothing for long stretches while a transfer was ready to go. Both waits are gone: a fixed delay between a sync and a send is itself a recognisable pattern on the network rather than protection from one, so pacing is no longer done by the clock. Migration steps now run when they are actually due, and anything you ask for that needs a sync — pulling to refresh, starting a send — is never held back. The only remaining pause is the few seconds while a migration transaction is actually being submitted.
- [Ironwood] Migration transactions are now labeled by what they do: the Activity list and the transaction detail screen show "Splitting Balance…"/"Balance Split"/"Split Failed" for note-preparation transactions and "Migrating…"/"Migrated"/"Migration Failed" for pool transfers, with a dedicated coins-swap icon. Their amount now shows the value being moved instead of the transaction fee, without a minus sign — migrations move funds inside your wallet, they don't spend them.
- [Ironwood] In-progress migration transactions appear in the Activity list as soon as they are prepared, clearly labeled with their live state, instead of being hidden until mined.
- [MOB-1466] The warning shown before a manual send during a scheduled migration is now more precise — it only appears when that specific send would actually spend Orchard funds the migration needs, instead of whenever any unmigrated Orchard balance remains in the account.
- [MOB-1466] The "ready to run" step badge in the migration plan's Split Balance row now shows its step number instead of a checkmark, to avoid reading as already completed.
- [Ironwood] Migration plan previews now show sane value breakdowns: exact funding amounts are preserved, and a split that cannot be funded reports as deferred instead of complete.
- [Ironwood] The migration reminder is now armed from the engine's own next-work answer as well as the schedule, so the "come back" notification lands at the earliest genuinely serviceable moment — and never inside the privacy buffer for send work.
- [MOB-1466] Migration status text now says what is happening right now: while transfers are being prepared, or while one is being sent, the Migration Progress screen says so and asks you to keep ZODL open; the rest of the time it tells you we will notify you when it is your turn. The note above the Got it button follows the same state, so the screen and the home banner can no longer describe different things.
- [MOB-1466] The Confirm Transfer Plan screens now explain the arrangement the same way in both cases — how long the run takes, that we notify you at each step, and that opening the app promptly keeps it on track. They no longer say the migration continues "in the background", which iOS does not allow.
- [MOB-1466] The notifications request now explains why it matters: iOS will not let transfers send in the background, so local notifications are the only way ZODL can tell you when to open it and take the next step.
- [MOB-1466] While ZODL is checking migration status on open, the migration banner no longer offers a button and the Migration Progress screen cannot be opened — until the check finishes, that screen would only show the previous session's numbers.
- [MOB-1466] Migration banner states now stay on screen for at least half a second each, so a quick run of changes reads as separate states instead of a flicker you cannot follow. Rapid updates to the same state (for example a rising transfer count) update in place without adding delay.

### Removed
- [MOB-1466] The "Updating…" label and the "Balances as of ~N min ago" line have been removed from the Migration Progress screen. Both described how fresh ZODL's own reads were rather than anything you can act on, and neither was part of the design.

### Fixed
- [MOB-1496] While a balance-splitting migration transaction is actually being sent, the app now knows it is busy: the keep-open banner shows for the duration of the send, exactly as it does for a migration transfer, and re-entering the migration flow mid-send is held off the same way. Previously the send ran with no visible state at all, so nothing asked you to keep ZODL open and backgrounding it at the wrong moment could stall the split until a later pass.
- [MOB-1496] When the network permanently rejects one of the balance-splitting transactions a migration prepares (a validation verdict, not a connection problem), the migration engine is now told the real outcome instead of nothing. Previously the app treated every non-acceptance as a retryable network error, so it kept re-submitting the same doomed transaction every pass and every 30-second check until it expired — hours in the split phase with no failure surface. Now the run can re-evaluate and ask for your attention instead.
- [MOB-1496] A migration transfer being sent can no longer collide with the automatic server switch: like every other send, the transfer now holds the submission guard for the duration of its broadcast, so a server change waits (or skips) instead of tearing down the connection while the transfer is still on the wire.
- [MOB-1496] A scheduled migration transfer that came due between syncs could sit undelivered for the whole time the app stayed open — in one field session, over 50 minutes — because the app judged "is it due?" on a different clock than the one it paced sync by, and neither side could break the tie. Both sides now read the same clock, so a transfer that is due is simply delivered at the next opportunity.
- The transaction list no longer sits empty for tens of seconds after a cold app start while migration checks and sync startup run — loading now begins as soon as the wallet's accounts are available.
- [MOB-1466] A sent migration transfer's checkmark, amount and transaction id now always land on the transfer that was actually broadcast: the app previously assumed sends happen in the plan's original row order, so once the engine (correctly) sent the earliest-scheduled transfer instead, the wrong row could show as sent — and its later confirmation could be matched against the wrong transaction.
- [MOB-1466] The transaction history no longer shows up empty on a populated wallet: a database read failure could silently discard the whole list (seen in the field when every stored transaction hit a strict decode of an always-empty trust column — fixed in the SDK), and such a failure is now logged instead of vanishing without a trace.
- [MOB-1466] The Home pool-balances sheet no longer counts scheduled migration transfers that have not mined yet: the Ironwood and Orchard cards now tell the same story as the Migration Status screen, instead of showing value as already moved hours or days early.
- [MOB-1466] The balances sheet's "Pending" row no longer claims the whole migration plan as pending minutes after you confirm it: value sitting in scheduled, not-yet-mined migration transfers is excluded from that row (your genuine pending sends and change still show), so the row only counts value you can expect to become spendable soon.
- [MOB-1466] Opening Migration Progress for the first time after launch no longer stutters the push animation — the screen's one-time rendering setup now runs invisibly right after the app starts, so even the first open animates smoothly.
- [MOB-1466] The "Prepare Your Balance" and dust-lock explainer sheets now update live while presented (their content could previously freeze on the state it opened with), and opening Migration Progress no longer floods the debug console with observation warnings.
- [MOB-1466] Opening an already-synced wallet now reliably shows the migration offer in the banner. Previously, if the app checked for the offer in the first seconds of launch — before sync had formally caught up — the offer was declined once and never asked again, so a wallet with Orchard funds could sit with a currency-conversion banner and no way to start migrating until the app was backgrounded and reopened.
- [MOB-1466] The migration offer no longer waits for a whole extra sync cycle when the launch check lands moments before sync formally catches up: a declined offer now re-checks itself right after catch-up instead of depending on a sync-status transition that can be missed. Seen in the field with a Keystone account whose offer only appeared after the second sync.
- [MOB-1466] Opening Migration Progress from the banner no longer shows a long loader on the first open after app launch while transfers are being proven — the progress data is snapshotted just before proving starts, so the screen always opens on content.
- [MOB-1466] Double-tapping "Next" on the migration entry screen, or "Allow"/"Skip" on its notifications step, can no longer push the next screen twice — a duplicate that could also invalidate the migration plan being prepared underneath.
- [MOB-1466] Opening the migration flow now pauses the automatic completion check that could otherwise invalidate the very plan you were reviewing, which surfaced as a "plan is stale" error on confirm.
- [MOB-1466] The migration's round counter no longer over-counts when a completion check hits a momentary error — labels like "Round 4 of 2" can no longer occur.
- [MOB-1466] While the Send-now privacy wait is counting down, a foreground sync restart can no longer cut the wait short and re-stamp the very quiet-period it exists to let pass.
- [MOB-1466] Fixed two narrow races in how the app listens for the migration sync gate: an edge arriving at the exact moment of re-subscription is no longer dropped, and the listener now shuts down while the app is backgrounded instead of being able to restart sync from the background.
- [MOB-1466] Backing out of the Migration Progress screen while a reschedule is still finishing no longer fires internal warnings — a result whose screen is gone is dropped cleanly.
- [MOB-1466] When the migration needs something only you can do — a Keystone signature for a rebuilt transfer, a re-plan after a problem, or proving that has stalled — the app now schedules a reminder notification. Previously a blocked run armed no wake-up at all, so a backgrounded wallet never told you it was waiting.
- [MOB-1466] "Migrate anyway" on the migration Complete screen no longer ends up permanently disabled after a successful unlock followed by going back — the button re-arms every time the screen appears.
- [MOB-1466] Scanning a Keystone signature now keeps its Cancel button available while the signed transaction is being processed — a hung submission previously left the screen with no way out (the back button is hidden while the camera is up, and Cancel used to be replaced by the progress indicator).
- [MOB-1466] Abandoned migration attempts no longer leave a stale server preference behind: closing the migration flow without confirming — or the app quitting mid-flow — now clears the provisional network settings that attempt formed, so automatic server selection and the server-switch privacy warning stop acting on a migration that doesn't exist, and a later real broadcast can no longer inherit an abandoned attempt's endpoint or Tor choice.
- [MOB-1466] "Send now" during a scheduled migration now honors the privacy quiet-period wait it always documented — the wait step existed in code but was never armed by the production flow — and its success message no longer mislabels the send as a manual-delivery step.
- [MOB-1466] On wallets with more than one account, one account's held migration transfer (for example an account set to manual delivery, or to immediate mode) no longer blocks the other account's scheduled deliveries from running.
- [MOB-1466] Migration status and logs now report a broadcast only when one actually went out — a failed or empty send attempt previously looked identical to a successful one, which made a stuck run read as healthy.
- [MOB-1466] A momentary failure while restarting sync (a network blip, Tor still bootstrapping) no longer freezes the wallet for the rest of the session — the app keeps listening for recovery signals and automatically retries once shortly after.
- [MOB-1466] Fixed a rare race where a failed migration transfer's recovery signal could be lost if it arrived at the exact moment the app was re-establishing its internal subscriptions, which left syncing stopped until the next app open.
- [MOB-1466] A migration sync resume that arrives while the device is briefly low on disk space, or while the wallet is still preparing, is no longer swallowed — it is retried at the next opportunity. Background sync completions also no longer suppress the following foreground's migration processing.
- [MOB-1466] Fixed a Keystone signing bug that could silently drop a scheduled migration's signed transfers when the plan included balance-preparation transactions: the schedule half of the signed batch was deferred to a step that never ran, so the app reported "Migration Scheduled" while those transfers were never stored. Both halves now store together, and a storage failure shows an error instead of a success screen.
- [MOB-1466] Migration reminder notifications now survive on wallets with more than one account: arming one account's reminder no longer erases the other account's, and an account with nothing pending no longer wipes every reminder wallet-wide.
- [MOB-1466] The migration's 30-second foreground automation no longer stops for the whole session after a momentary hiccup (a busy database read, or the sync engine briefly restarting) — transient errors are reported and retried instead of being mistaken for "nothing to do".
- [MOB-1466] The Migration Progress screen's automatic 30-second refresh now stops when the screen closes. Previously it kept running invisibly after leaving the screen, doing repeated background work for a screen nobody could see until the app was relaunched.
- [MOB-1466] Migration transactions that become ready while the app sits open on a fully synced wallet are now prepared within 30 seconds. Previously their preparation could wait until the next app open — the wallet stays continuously synced, and the moment preparation used to be tied to never came around again — which could leave the migration showing no progress for minutes even though nothing was wrong.
- [MOB-1466] Confirming a migration while the wallet is already fully synced now starts preparing the first transaction right away. Previously the run could sit at "Preparing…" indefinitely — the first proof only ran at a sync-completion moment that had already passed by the time the migration was confirmed, and nothing re-triggered it until the app was closed and reopened.
- [MOB-1466] Scheduled migration transfers no longer get stuck behind the privacy buffer while the app stays open: when a transfer is ready to send, the wallet pauses syncing while the privacy quiet-period elapses — up to 10 minutes on mainnet — then sends the transfer automatically.
- [MOB-1466] The Migration Progress screen now refreshes itself while open — transfer ETAs and statuses update every 30 seconds without closing and reopening the screen.
- [MOB-1466] The migration plan review screen (before you confirm) now describes transfers in forward-looking terms — "Starts right away" / "Starts in ~N mins" / "Starts in ~N hours" — instead of "Ready now", so the screen doesn't read as if transfers are already under way before you've confirmed anything.
- [MOB-1466] The migration plan review screen's action button now reads "Start migration" instead of "Confirm", making clear that tapping it is what actually starts your migration.
- [MOB-1466] Leaving the migration plan review screen via the back button, before you've started the plan, now asks you to confirm first — "Your migration hasn't started yet. Leaving now won't schedule any transfers." — so you can't accidentally back out thinking your migration is already underway.
- [MOB-1466] A successful migration transfer no longer wedges the wallet: the sync gate's refusal to start (part of the migration privacy protection) is now handled as the broadcast session it actually signals, instead of showing a fatal, unrecoverable initialization error.
- [MOB-1466] The Migration Progress screen and banner now always show the engine's live state — the stale-cache layer that could show an outdated transfer/split status (or a pre-commit empty screen) while proving ran has been removed.
- [MOB-1466] Opening the migration from the banner no longer flashes or stacks the mode-picker screen beneath the migration progress screen.
- [MOB-1466] Swiping back off the very first screen shown when re-opening an in-progress migration now closes the migration flow, instead of leaving a blank, stuck screen with no way forward except quitting the app.
- The Confirm button on a migration transfer plan now keeps its loading indicator up until your transfers are prepared and presigned (the first delivery kicked off), then opens the Migration Scheduled screen — one tap, no dead first tap, and the Home banner reflects the committed run when you return. The Confirm button still can no longer be tapped again after a successful commit.
- [Ironwood] Accepting a migration plan on a large wallet no longer stalls for tens of minutes — plan commit completes promptly.

## [3.8.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- [MOB-1581] The Activity list now shows a sent transaction immediately after sending, regardless of how the send flow is closed, instead of waiting for the next sync cycle.
- [MOB-1593] Transaction detail no longer shows an extra, empty message bubble on sent transactions, and "Send again" prefills the actual message text again.

### Changed
- [MOB-1580] A transaction sent to yourself — a manual send to your own address, or a migration transfer between your own pools — now always shows the network fee rather than an amount that could differ between devices or change once the transaction confirmed.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- [Ironwood] ZODL now recognizes funds held in the Ironwood shielded pool. Balances on the home screen, in the balances breakdown and in the shielding banner include Ironwood alongside Sapling and Orchard, so those funds are visible and counted as soon as the network upgrade activates.
- [Ironwood] A transfer that moves funds into the Ironwood pool now shows the amount that actually moved, in both the transaction list and the transaction detail screen. Previously such a transfer displayed only its fee.
- [Ironwood] Once ZODL sees that the Ironwood network upgrade is live on the network, it shows a short one-time screen introducing the change, with a link to a support article. It appears once per device — after you continue past it, it never comes back.
- [MOB-1535] Tapping your balance on the home screen now opens a "Total Balance Across Pools" breakdown showing how much ZEC sits in each Zcash pool — Orchard, Sapling, Transparent and Ironwood — so you can see exactly where your funds are. When currency conversion is turned on, each pool also shows its value in your selected currency. Pools you hold nothing in are still listed, and with balances hidden every amount stays masked.

### Changed
- [Ironwood] Coinholder Polling is temporarily unavailable and no longer appears in Settings, while voting is brought up to date with the Ironwood network upgrade. No voting data is deleted — the feature returns in a later release.
- [MOB-1510] Signing with a Keystone device now requires firmware 3.0.1 or newer — older or version-less firmware is blocked with an update prompt before anything is broadcast, and the prompt reports the firmware version exactly as your Keystone displays it.
- [MOB-1535] The "Total Balance Across Pools" breakdown now shows each pool's balance to its full precision (up to 8 decimal places) instead of flooring to 0.001 ZEC, so small amounts are no longer hidden, and the pools now appear in the order Ironwood, Orchard, Sapling, Transparent.

### Fixed
- [Ironwood] The automatic recovery from another wallet's leftover data (see MOB-1512 below) keeps working with the updated Zcash SDK. The SDK now reports that mismatch as an error rather than a status, so ZODL maps it back onto the same recovery and the wallet still heals itself instead of stopping on an initialization error.
- [MOB-140] On the Receive screen, the Zcash Sapling address (testnet debug builds only) now shows the same shield badge on its icon as the Zcash Shielded Address, instead of an incomplete badge that made the address look unshielded.
- [#1948] The Syncing Error details now name the server ZODL is connected to and show both consensus branch IDs in hex (e.g. `0x37a5165b`) — the form used in ZIPs and other documentation — rather than unrecognizable decimal numbers, and the same information is included in the report sent to support. When the failure is a network-rules mismatch (ZCBPEO0011), where retrying can never succeed because either ZODL or the server is out of date, the sheet also offers a Switch server shortcut.
- [#1943] Fixed a wallet initialization bug: initialization is now single-flight, so repeated startup triggers while the wallet is still initializing are ignored until it finishes.
- [#1920] Connecting a Keystone hardware wallet that fails now shows a clear "Connection Failed" message (with Contact Support and Cancel options) instead of silently doing nothing. Cancel leaves the flow so the user is never stuck on the connection screen. The support message includes a safe error identifier and never exposes any wallet keys.
- [#1920] The "Connection Failed" sheet no longer appears on top of the success screen when connecting a Keystone device actually succeeds. Tapping the connect/OK button again while the import was still running started a duplicate import whose failure surfaced as a bogus error; the button now shows a progress indicator and extra taps are ignored.
- [PRO-325] Swaps out of ZEC and CrossPays that fail on the swap provider's side now show "Swap Failed" / "Payment Failed" (with the contact-support option) instead of appearing to stay in progress forever. Long-running swaps in this direction also correctly show their processing state.
- [MOB-1475] The refund address explainer no longer reads like "USDC on NEAR" is a fixed destination for every refund — it now says the refund returns in the source currency on the same network, since that's true for any swap, not just NEAR-based ones.
- [MOB-1512] Setting up a wallet over leftover data from a different wallet (e.g. after restoring a device backup onto a new device) no longer shows the old wallet's unspendable balance and no longer fails shielding/spending with ZRUST0002; ZODL now detects the mismatch, removes the stale database, and re-syncs the correct wallet, informing the user with an alert. This also clears the previous wallet's voting configuration and history, session state, and cached preferences so none of it can leak into the current wallet.
- [MOB-1512] The "Wallet data replaced" notice now stays on screen after the healed wallet opens, instead of disappearing during the transition to the home screen.
- [Keystone] Switching between the ZODL and Keystone accounts now always shows the selected account's transaction history — a slow in-flight refresh for the previous account can no longer overwrite it — and connecting a Keystone hardware wallet refreshes the transaction list and balance immediately.
- [Keystone] The transaction list no longer gets stuck showing its loading placeholder when switching to an account whose transaction list turns out identical to the previous one — in practice, switching between two accounts that both have no transactions, such as right after connecting a Keystone.

## 3.7.3 build 1 (2026-07-12)

### Changed
- [MOB-1472] The assets you can swap are now a curated set of major coins and stablecoins across the supported chains (plus swapping to ZEC), instead of the full list from the swap provider, and the address-book chain picker is limited to those chains. Existing swaps in your history (including assets no longer offered) still display normally, and existing contacts on other chains are preserved.

## 3.7.2 build 1

### Added
- [MOB-1418] The Server Setup screen now explains that Automatic mode may use multiple servers to optimize performance, and points you to Manual connection mode (plus enabling Tor in Advanced Settings) if you'd prefer to reduce metadata exposure.

### Changed
- [MOB-1348] QR / payment-request (ZIP-321) codes that contain more than one recipient are now rejected instead of silently processing only the first recipient, so what you review is always exactly what gets signed.
- [MOB-1130] The syncing widget now stays visible until the wallet is within a fixed number of blocks of the network tip, instead of hiding at a fixed percentage of total blocks. Previously, wallets with an older birthday height could stop showing the syncing status while still having a meaningful amount left to sync.

### Fixed
- [MOB-1352] Paying with Flexa now requires a ZODL (mobile) account and is blocked for Keystone (hardware) accounts, which have no on-device key to sign with. Switching accounts also ends any open Flexa session so a payment can't bind to the wrong account.
- [MOB-1188] Disconnecting a Keystone hardware wallet no longer fails with a "couldn't be finalized" error when that account has transactions involving your other accounts.

## 3.7.0 build 1

### Fixed
- When a send fails because the wallet's chain state changed between tapping review and confirm (due to syncing catching up, a reorg, or the app resuming from background), a clear actionable message is now shown instead of the generic error copy.

### Changed
- Sending, swapping, shielding, and Flexa payments now broadcast your transaction to multiple servers at once when you're in Automatic server mode (Manual mode still uses the server you selected), so a single slow or unreachable server is less likely to make a submission fail. If a server times out before confirming, you now see a clear message that your transaction may still have been broadcast, rather than an outright failure.

### Fixed
- A sent transaction that broadcast on an older app version and never mined now correctly shows as "Failed" in the Activity list once its expiry passes the network chain tip. Previously it could stay stuck on "Sending" indefinitely after updating the app.
- Opening the Recovery Phrase from Advanced Settings now always requires Face ID / Touch ID, and the seed words are only loaded and rendered after a successful authentication.
- The tax CSV export is now written to a protected location and deleted as soon as the share sheet closes, instead of remaining in temporary storage.
- Exported support logs no longer leave plaintext files behind: staging files are removed right after the ZIP is built and the ZIP is deleted when the share sheet closes.
- Turning Tor on or off now applies to exchange-rate, swap and voting requests immediately instead of after the next app launch.

### Removed
- A hidden legacy debug menu (reachable via a gesture on the splash screen) that could copy the seed phrase to the clipboard without Face ID / Touch ID.

## 3.6.0 build 7 (20026-06-17)

### Added
- Server selection now offers an Automatic mode that benchmarks known servers and keeps your wallet on the fastest one; Manual mode still lets you pin a specific server. Automatic switching is paused while sending, swapping, shielding, or voting.

## 3.5.2 build 1 (20026-06-08)

### Changed
- Voting UI improvements.

### Fixed
- A connection timeout on iOS that could leave the wallet stuck mid-sync after fetching transactions.

### Removed
- Servers scheduled for decommissioning from the server list.

## 3.5.1 build 2 (2026-06-01)

### Changed
- Default server set to zec.rocks.
- We now keep the screen awake while you're submitting Coinholder Polling votes — including the Keystone QR signing step — so the device doesn't lock mid-submission.

### Added
- Tapping Enter Poll on a poll from a custom (unverified) data source now surfaces an "Unverified Poll" warning sheet, letting you go back or proceed at your own risk.

### Fixed
- We fixed the Coinholder Polling review screen so it now shows "Voted <date>" once you've submitted your ballot, instead of the round's upcoming end date.
- We removed an unused "Review your submitted votes" subtitle from the Coinholder Polling review screen header to match the design.
- We suppressed the Coinholder Polling "Poll Closed" sheet for users who already submitted their ballot — telling someone they can no longer vote right after voting is just noise.
- We corrected the tally-bar colors on the Coinholder Polling answers screen: green for Yes/Support, red for No/Oppose, gray for Abstain, blue for everything else — matching the rest of the voting screens.
- We now show a specific message when an attempt to vote fails because the same wallet has already voted from another device, instead of the generic "Check your connection" copy.

## 3.5.0 build 1 (2026-05-27)

### Added
- Coinholder Polling lets you vote on Zcash governance privately, right from your Zodl and Keystone wallets.

## 3.4.1 build 1 (2026-05-18)

### Changed

### Fixed
- We fixed a bug that prevented shielding when many small transparent inputs were involved.
- We fixed a broken Restore Wallet flow when switching Tor ON in the Tor sheet — the Restore button now takes you to the next screen in both Tor ON and Tor OFF cases.

## 3.4.0 build 1 (2026-05-11)

### Added
- We added Wallet Birthday Height support to the Connect Keystone hardware wallet flow, so your transaction history and funds can be restored correctly.

### Changed

- `Keys Missing` error dialog was sometimes triggered as a false positive due to system overload and keychain API unresponsivity in expected time. Retry logic was implemented to pass this state. Also the app always lands users to the Account tab instead of lock them on a splash screen with no options to solve this state.

## 0.2.0 build 12 (2024-01-20)

### Added
- The exported logs also show the shielded balances (total & verified) for every finished sync metric.
- Synchronization in the background. When the iPhone is connected to the power and wifi, the background task will try to synchronize randomly between 3-4am.
- Restore of the wallet is now indiated in the UI throughout the application.
- A hint box that elucidates transparent funds and shielding on the Balances tab.

### Fixed
- The export buttons are disabled when exporting of the private data is in progress.
- The alert message and title for the failed transaction send.

## 0.2.0 build 11 (2023-12-13)

### Added
- Option to export SDK and wallet logs in `Export private data` screen.

### Changed
- The background of Onboarding and some of the Settings screen has been updated to show a subtle texture of a grid pattern.
- The sapling address + QR code has been restored on the Receive tab (for testnet only.)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that caused spends to appear to be stuck.
- The confirmation screen has been altered such that the message bubble is rendered only when the message is non-empty.

## 0.2.0 build 10 (2023-11-30)

### Changed
- The way how the balances (zatoshi amounts/values) are represented has been updated accoridng to the latest requirements. In general any zatoshi value has 2 major states, expanded or abbreviated. Trailing zeroes are trimmed when expanded.
- The `Balances` screen has been redesigned: new progress bar with the status of the synchronization, all balances available. Penging fields are disabled for now and show only zeroes until support from the SDK is implemented.
- When the send button is tapped, the sending title + spinner is shown instead of just the spinner. Also, when the send is done, and redirect to the Account page is done, the sending transaction is already populated in the list. The lag between it was presented has been fixed.

### Removed
- [testnet only] The sapling address and the QR of it has been removed from the receive screen. The only meaningful options are the UA and the transparent addresses.

### Added
- Confirmation screen when sending funds. The initial screen is about filling in the address, amount and message (optional). The butoon `review` leads to a brand new screen where the summary of the transaction is presented. The send is confirmed by tapping the send button. Going back to update send data is possible via `go back` button.

## 0.2.0 build 9 (2023-11-14)

### Changed
- Send (tab) redesigned: All the input fields are at the same screen. The screen is scrollable so it's usable on every possible iPhone.
- Complete redesign of transactions on the Account tab. Expandable transactions show details of it, including options to copy transaction IDs as well as addresses.

### Added
- The concept of read/unread transactions with the message (memo) implemented. The color of the icon of received transaction that holds message and hasn't been read yet is yellow. Once the transaction is expanded, the icon's color flips to the black and the state is persisted.

## 0.2.0 build 6 (2023-11-01)

### Added
- Option to export private data: brand new screen accessible via Settings, where once consent acknowledged, a user can export a database of data. Important note: the data are sensitive because it holds some information about user's transactions and history but spending keys are not exported so lost of funds is not possible.

## 0.2.0 build 5 (2023-10-26)

### Changed
- Settings screen has been redesigned and options on the screen changed.
- Truncation of the balances changed from 8 floating points to the 3 only.
- Restore from the seed flow and UI updated.

### Added
- Option to copy the seed to the pasteboard when a new wallet is created and the seed presented.

## 0.2.0 build 4 (2023-10-13)

### Changed
- About screen UI updated.
- The main navigation of the Zashi changed, now the wallet is tab based with Account, Send, Receive and Balances tabs.
- Home screen is now called Account.
- Receive screen UI updated.
- Recovery screen UI updated (the screen with the seed presented).

### Added
- The security warning screen with that is presented when the new wallet is created now holds a link in the text that takes a user to the privacy policy.

## 0.2.0 build 3 (2023-10-05)

### Changed
- Zashi design buttons
- Splash screen: new animated screen with the logo + HI text.
- Security warning screen UI updated.
- State and progress of the synchronizer moved from the Home screen to the balance breakdown screen.

## 0.2.0 build 1 (2023-10-03)

### Changed
- The send button is disabled until the spendable balance is not a zero.

### Added
- The wallet now handles lifecycle events: when the app goes to the background and back to the foreground. That fixed lightwalletd errors.

 - when transparent address is filled in a send form, the memo input is still present in the UI, memo is not supported by transparent addresses so it should be removed
