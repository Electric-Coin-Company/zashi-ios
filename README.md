Zashi Wallet uses [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) and 
[SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen) to conform to our coding
guidelines for source code and generate accessors for assets. Please install
these locally when contributing to the project, they are run automatically when
you build.

## Installation of Swiftgen & Swiftlint on Apple Silicon-based hardware

### Swiftgen

Install it using homebrew
```
$ brew install swiftgen
```
and create a symbolic link
```
ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/swiftgen /usr/local/bin
```

### Swiftlint

The project is setup to work with `0.50.3` version. We recommend to install it
directly using [the official 0.50.3 package](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/releases/download/0.50.3/SwiftLint.pkg).
If you follow this step there is no symbolic link needed.

In case you already have swiftlint 0.50.3 ready on your machine and installed via homebrew, create a symbolic link
```
ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/swiftlint /usr/local/bin
```
