#!/usr/bin/env bash
# End-to-end test of the delegation recovery path on a simulator.
#
# Runs the on-device suite that OPENS THE APP against a corrupted voting
# database and asserts the broadcast secrets came back.
#
# The suite builds and plants that database itself, using the same builder the
# in-process tests use, so this script only has to stand up a simulator and
# report honestly on what the run did.
#
# Recovery has no user-facing trigger: it runs off the launch action the app
# delegate sends, invisibly. So the suite drives `Root` through
# `.didFinishLaunching` with the real recovery client and the real file-backed
# escrow beneath it, and the escrow file on disk is the observable, since a
# fire-and-forget launch returns nothing to assert on.
#
# That distinction is what this script exists to protect. The carver, the
# probe and the escrow are all covered in-process; only an on-device run can
# show that opening the app is what sets them going. A change that unhooked
# recovery from launch would leave every other test green.
#
# The interesting part is the planting. A running app holds an open SQLite
# connection, and when that connection closes SQLite checkpoints and unlinks
# the write-ahead log, which is the only place a cleared round's originals
# survive. So the app is terminated before the copy and the whole three-file
# set is planted together: the main database alone would silently roll back to
# its last checkpoint.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/e2e/run-delegation-recovery-e2e.sh [-d "iPhone 17"] [-k]
#
#   -d  simulator device name (default: iPhone 17)
#   -k  keep the simulator booted and the planted files in place afterwards
#
# Environment:
#   DERIVED          derived data path (default: build/e2e-derived-data)
