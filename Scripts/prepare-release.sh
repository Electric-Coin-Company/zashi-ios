Usage: ./Scripts/prepare-release.sh start [options] <remote> <version> [<revision>]

Creates release/X.Y.Z from the previous release tag and pushes it; creates
candidate/X.Y.Z from the revision being released; promotes the CHANGELOG's
Unreleased section; records the version in the Xcode project; and opens a pull
request from the candidate branch into the release branch.

Basing the release branch on the previous release tag is what makes the pull
request worth reviewing: its diff is exactly what users receive relative to the
last release, rather than the intervening development history.

Arguments:
  <remote>    git remote for the repository being released, e.g. upstream
  <version>   version being released, e.g. 3.11.0
  <revision>  commit or branch holding the changes to release
              (default: current HEAD)

Options:
  --issue <N>       release tracking issue, referenced from the PR body.
  --build <N>       build number to record alongside the version (default: 1).
                    Build numbers are a per-variant App Store Connect sequence,
                    and Scripts/release.sh passes its own --build at archive
                    time, so this is only the project's recorded starting point.
  --previous <tag>  base the release branch on this tag rather than the detected
                    one. Use when the newest tag reachable from <revision> is not
                    the release you are following.
  --dry-run         print what would happen and change nothing.

Release \`${version}\`, following \`${prev_tag}\`.

The base of this pull request is \`release/${version}\`, which starts out
identical to \`${prev_tag}\`. Its diff is therefore exactly what users receive
relative to the last release, rather than the intervening development history.

On top of the released content this branch carries:

- the CHANGELOG's Unreleased section, promoted to \`## [${version}]\`;
- \`MARKETING_VERSION\` and \`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION\`, set across every
  non-test target.

## Do not merge before the build has shipped

TestFlight and App Store builds for this release are made from
\`candidate/${version}\`, the head of this pull request:

    ./Scripts/release.sh --variant internal-testnet --ref candidate/${version} \\
        --version ${version} --build <n>

Fixes found in testing land on \`candidate/${version}\` and appear here. This
pull request stays a **draft** while builds are in progress; marking it ready
for review is part of declaring the release final, and merging it is what makes
it final. Tag \`release/${version}\` afterwards, then merge it back into
\`${maint_line}\` and forward to \`main\` so the tag stays reachable. Make each
merge with \`--no-commit\` and check that \`## [${version}]\` in the CHANGELOG
still matches the tag before committing — entries added on the target branch
during the release cycle merge into the published section without a conflict.
