# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Zodl (formerly Zashi) is an iOS Zcash wallet built with SwiftUI and The Composable Architecture (TCA). It uses the Zcash Swift SDK (`ZcashLightClientKit`) for blockchain operations.

## Build & Development

**Prerequisites:** Install SwiftGen (`brew install swiftgen`) and SwiftLint (v0.50.3 specifically - use the official .pkg installer). Both run automatically during Xcode builds.

**Build targets / schemes:**
- `zodl-internal` - internal/development build (mainnet/ZEC); its scheme also runs the `zodlTests` test target
- `zodl-testnet` - testnet build (TAZ token)
- `zodl-production` - production / App Store build (mainnet/ZEC), built via the `zodl-AppStore` scheme
- `zodlTests` - test target (run via the `zodl-internal` scheme)
- Conditional compilation via `SECANT_MAINNET` / `SECANT_TESTNET` (plus `SECANT_DISTRIB` on the App Store config). These flags keep the legacy `SECANT_` prefix even though the targets are now named `zodl-*`.

**Build:** Open `secant.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build the desired scheme (CI builds with `xcodebuild -project secant.xcodeproj`).

**Tests:** Run the `zodlTests` target in Xcode (scheme `zodl-internal`). All tests use **Swift Testing** (`@Suite` / `@Test` / `#expect` / `#require`) — **write every new test in Swift Testing, never XCTest.** Tests use TCA's `TestStore` with dependency injection (`.noOp`, `withDependencies`, etc.). Swift Testing runs suites in parallel by default, so mark any suite that mutates process-global state (named `UserDefaults` suites, the OSLog store, shared singletons / TCA `@Shared` state) with `@Suite(.serialized)`.

**Linting:** SwiftLint runs as a build phase. Config: `.swiftlint.yml` (app code) and `.swiftlint_tests.yml` (tests, more relaxed). Key enforced rules: no string concatenation (use interpolation), no `NSLog`, no `print`/`debugPrint` in app code, TODOs must reference issue numbers (`TODO: [#123]`).

## Architecture

**TCA (The Composable Architecture)** drives all state management, using modern macros (`@Reducer`, `@ObservableState`, `@Dependency`). Each feature has:
- `<Feature>Store.swift` - State, Action, Reducer, dependencies
- `<Feature>View.swift` - SwiftUI view consuming the store
- `<Feature>Coordinator.swift` (some features) - Navigation glue between screens

**Source layout** (`secant/Sources/`):
- `Features/` - Screen-level features (~40), each in its own directory
- `Features/CoordFlows/` - Multi-screen coordinator flows (Send, Restore, Scan, SwapAndPay, AddKeystoneHWWallet, RequestZec, SignWithKeystone, Transactions, Voting, WalletBackup). Each flow has `<Name>CoordFlowStore.swift`, `<Name>CoordFlowView.swift`, and `<Name>CoordFlowCoordinator.swift`. Most are flat files directly in `CoordFlows/`; Voting lives in its own `VotingCoordFlow/` subdirectory.
- `Dependencies/` - Dependency clients (~49) wrapping SDK, iOS, and custom services
- `UIComponents/` - Reusable UI building blocks (buttons, text fields, badges, etc.)
- `Models/` - Shared data types (TransactionState, StoredWallet, WalletAccount, SwapAsset, Swaps, WalletStatus, etc.)
- `Utils/` - Helpers and extensions
- `Generated/` - SwiftGen output (assets, fonts) - do not edit manually
- `Resources/` - Assets, fonts (Inter, RobotoMono, Zboto, Michroma), Lottie animations, localizations

**Root feature** (`Features/Root/`) is the app coordinator - handles wallet initialization, navigation, and deep linking across 12 files.

**Dependencies** use the `@DependencyClient` macro from `swift-dependencies` on a struct with `@Sendable` closures (Swift 6 concurrency). Layout per client:
- `<Name>Interface.swift` - `@DependencyClient struct <Name>Client { ... }` plus the `DependencyValues` extension
- `<Name>LiveKey.swift` - `liveValue` conformance for production
- `<Name>TestKey.swift` - **only when** the macro-generated default isn't enough; otherwise omit (the macro provides `testValue` automatically). Tests can also override individual closures inline via `withDependencies`.

Closures must be `@Sendable`. Use `@preconcurrency import ZcashLightClientKit` when an SDK type is not yet `Sendable`.

**Transaction guard (`Dependencies/TransactionGuard/`)** — the SDK's `switchTo(endpoint:)` tears down and rebuilds the synchronizer, so it must never overlap a transaction broadcast. A shared, non-reentrant FIFO-mutex actor (`@Dependency(\.transactionGuard)`) enforces this **inside the dependency LiveKeys** — feature code never wraps broadcasts; the one feature-level guard use is the manual switch (`switchWaiting`) in `ServerSetupStore`:
- Guarded closures (their `liveValue` acquires the guard internally): `sdkSynchronizer.createProposedTransactions`, `createTransactionFromPCZT`, `getTreeState`, and `votingAPI.submitVoteCommitment`, `submitDelegation`, `delegateShares`. (Voting's `resubmitShare` is deliberately unguarded — an idempotent, recoverable resubmission path.) A new broadcast-sensitive dependency closure must take the same wrap in its own LiveKey — never at call sites, and **never nested** (the guard is non-reentrant and will deadlock).
- Server switches: the manual Save path uses `switchWaiting { }` (waits for in-flight broadcasts, then wins). The automatic refresh is split into `autoServerSelection.findBestServer()` (read-only benchmark, safe anytime) and `applySwitch` (runs under `switchIfIdle { }`, which skips if a broadcast holds the guard). `withTimeout(serverSwitchTimeout)` bounds a switch.
- The automatic apply is additionally gated on live navigation state in Root: `.autoServerCandidateReady` defers while `Root.State.canApplyAutoServerSwitch` is false (sensitive flow on screen, Server Setup visible, or a background task), stashing the candidate in `pendingServerCandidate`; an `onChange` in `Root.body` re-feeds it when the gate clears (15-minute TTL). When adding a `Root.State.Path` case, the exhaustive switch in `isSensitiveFlowActive` forces classifying it as sensitive or not.

**Navigation** uses TCA's `StackState` with a `@Reducer enum Path` (coordinator pattern):
```swift
@Reducer
struct SomeCoordFlow {
    @Reducer
    enum Path {
        case scan(Scan)
        case sendConfirmation(SendConfirmation)
    }
    @ObservableState
    struct State { var path = StackState<Path.State>() }
    enum Action { case path(StackActionOf<Path>) }
}
```

## Code Conventions

- **Type definition order:** nested types -> static properties -> constants -> variables -> computed properties -> init -> instance methods -> extensions for protocol conformances
- **4-space indentation**, 150-char line length warning
- **File length:** 600 lines warning (relaxed in tests)
- **Force unwrapping and implicitly unwrapped optionals** are errors
- **String interpolation** required over concatenation
- **Features vs UI Components:** Features are standalone screens/flows; UI Components are reusable building blocks shared across features
- **Commit messages:** `[#<issue_number>] <descriptive title>`

## Design System

The app ships a complete design system — reusable SwiftUI components (`secant/Sources/UIComponents/`), colors (`Resources/Colors.xcassets`), image/icon assets (`Resources/Assets.xcassets`), and a localized string catalogue (`Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`). **All new UI work MUST reuse this design system as much as possible** rather than introducing bespoke equivalents.

- **Components:** Reuse the existing `UIComponents` (e.g. `ZashiButton`, plus the badges, text fields, toasts, sheets, toggles, toolbars, tooltips, etc. under `UIComponents/`) instead of hand-rolling new controls. Example: `ZashiButton(String(localizable: .generalRequest)) { action() }` — don't build a styled `Button` from scratch.
- **Colors:** Use the generated palette — `Asset.Colors.<name>.color` (including the `Asset.Colors.ZDesign.*` semantic ramp). Never hardcode `Color(red:green:blue:)` or hex literals.
- **Assets / icons:** Use bundled assets via `Asset.Assets.<name>.image` (namespaced, e.g. `Asset.Assets.Icons.*`, `Asset.Assets.Brandmarks.*`). Prefer these over SF Symbols (`Image(systemName:)`).
- **Strings:** Every user-facing string goes into `Localizable.xcstrings` and is referenced with `String(localizable: .someKey)` — the established idiom (~850 call sites; there are no hardcoded display literals in views). Never put display strings directly in code.
- **When the design system can't cover a need** — no suitable component, color, or asset exists — **stop and tell the user** instead of silently creating a one-off. Extend the design system deliberately, with the user's agreement, rather than diverging from it.

> `Asset.*` symbols are SwiftGen-generated into `Sources/Generated/` — do not edit those files; add the asset/color to the `.xcassets` catalogue and let the build regenerate them.

## CHANGELOG discipline

`CHANGELOG.md` exists for the people who use ZODL, and nothing else. Treat
every entry as text a user will read. (The App Store "What's New" copy is a
separate artifact — `secant/Resources/WhatsNew/whatsNew*.json`, maintained with
`/update-whatsnew` — not this file.)

- Update it for any **user-visible** change: a feature, a fix, a change in
  behaviour, or something removed. The entry **must** be part of the same commit
  that makes the change, not a follow-up. Treat it as part of "done", and add it
  without waiting to be asked.
- Add the entry under `## [Unreleased]`, in the matching `### Added` /
  `### Changed` / `### Fixed` / `### Removed` subsection — creating the
  subsection if it isn't there: promotion moves the subsections wholesale, so
  each cycle starts from a completely empty `## [Unreleased]`.
- Prefix every line with its issue identifier in brackets, e.g.
  `- [MOB-1321] Short, user-facing description of the change.`
- Entries carry **only** what a user needs: what is different for them, where
  they will meet it, and what they should do about it. Write it as they
  encounter it, not as the code does.
- **Never** describe implementation detail — a type, a dependency, a refactor —
  or narrate branch and release topology: which line merged into which, which
  release on another line carries the same change, which version numbers were
  skipped, why the file's ordering looks the way it does. None of that is
  actionable for a user.
- Record **only completed changes since the last release**, never the
  interstitial states of something changed several times since then. If a screen
  was added and then reworked before release, the entry describes what shipped.
- **Never modify an entry under an already-published version heading** — a
  `## [X.Y.Z] - DATE` section, or one of the legacy
  `## X.Y.Z build N (DATE)` ones, whose tag exists. Those are the historical
  record of what that release shipped, and must not be altered even to clarify
  or correct. New information goes under `## [Unreleased]`.
- A fix that lands on `candidate/X.Y.Z` after the CHANGELOG was promoted but
  before the release ships belongs under `## [X.Y.Z]` — that heading is not
  published history until its tag exists.
- Do **not** add a separate "Breaking changes" section. `### Changed` already is
  it: a user meets everything under that heading as something that used to work
  differently.
- Privacy, security, and cost properties are user-facing even when they are
  documented only in a code comment. A change that reveals data on-chain, costs
  a fee, or can fail at runtime belongs here.

**Not user-visible, so no entry:** developer tooling and scripts, CI workflows,
tests, build configuration, and refactors with no observable effect. An entry
for one of these is noise in a file a user reads.

`Scripts/prepare-release.sh start` promotes `## [Unreleased]` to
`## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` when the release is cut, and refuses if the section is
empty. `## [Unreleased]` itself always stays at the top, empty until the next
change lands. When preparing a release, audit by diffing the release range
rather than trusting the file to be complete — behaviour-only changes with no
visible UI change are the ones most often missed.
