//  MOB-1859: `walletAccounts()` no longer generates the rotation stash (`nextPrivateUA`) on
//  every load — that generation is a wallet-database write, and doing it for every account on
//  every load contended with the sync engine during catch-up. This file holds the pieces that
//  used to be duplicated across call sites, or missing entirely: a pure helper that carries a
//  stash forward across a reload instead of losing it, the shared background work that
//  (re)generates a stash address (previously copy-pasted between HomeStore and SwapAndPayStore),
//  and the single write path that keeps every shared copy of an account's stash — the
//  `walletAccounts` array included — in sync with each other.
