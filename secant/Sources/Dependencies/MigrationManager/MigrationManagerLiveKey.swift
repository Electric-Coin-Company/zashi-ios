//  MigrationManagerLiveKey.swift
//  Zashi
//
//  Live implementation of `MigrationManagerClient`. Every piece of actual logic is factored
//  into pure, table-testable types below (`MigrationDerivations`, `MigrationGateStorage`) so
//  `MigrationManagerTests` can exercise them without touching the SDK; this file is left with
//  only the wiring between those types and `@Dependency(\.sdkSynchronizer)` /
//  `@Dependency(\.zcashSDKEnvironment)`.
//
//  MOB-1496: `bannerVariant`/`reentryRoute`/`reconcile` now read the real per-account,
//  throwing SDK surface — every SDK read degrades to a safe default (false/nil/entry) on either a
//  missing selected account or a thrown error, so a migration-surface hiccup never crashes launch,
//  foreground entry, or the smart banner. `migrationSummary`/`migrationTransfers`/`lockMigrationDust`/
//  `stateEvents` are new here — relocated from `SDKSynchronizerClient` (summary/transfers/dust-lock
//  are app-side derivations/persistence, not SDK calls; stateEvents is the per-account replacement
//  for the old wallet-wide `migrationStateStream`). MOB-1749 (wave 2): the balance-derived lock
//  READ that arrived with them is gone — `residualBalances` answers it from one read.
//
//  MOB-1496 (W3) split the privacy gate across the SDK and this client: the SDK owned
//  broadcast->sync, this client owned sync->send via a post-sync cooldown. BOTH timed halves are
//  gone as of 2026-08-07. A fixed delay either side of the pair is an identifiable pattern rather
//  than a defense against one, so neither direction is paced by a clock now. What remains is the
//  SDK's present-tense hold — a submission actually in flight
//  (`SDKSynchronizerClient.isMigrationSyncBlocked`/`migrationSyncBlockedStream`, driven from
//  `RootInitialization.swift`'s `.retryStart`/`.migrationSyncGateChanged`) — plus this app's
//  stop-sync-before-broadcast sequencing. `recordSyncCompleted` survives, but purely as the
//  snapshot-republish edge it also always was; it no longer stamps a timestamp.
//
//  MOB-1497 (T1 of the Tor & broadcast-routing requirements round): four changes to the network
//  snapshot. (1) Forming moves from the first broadcast-bearing `migrationNetworkOptions` read to
//  the Tor-choice step (`formNetworkSnapshot`, called by the coordinator), with a provisional-
//  until-commit lifecycle — `MigrationNetworkSnapshot.committedAt` is nil until
//  `markNetworkSnapshotCommitted` stamps it (co-located inside `recordCommittedSchedule`, its one
//  production call site); a provisional snapshot is discarded at flow teardown
//  (`clearProvisionalNetworkSnapshot`) rather than surviving to be silently reused, and survives a
//  background reconcile's stale-`.notStarted` observation (`clearIfCommitted`, not the old
//  unconditional `clear`) so a user mid-flow never has their just-formed pick wiped out from under
//  them. `ensureNetworkSnapshot` (the old entry point) is now the safety net for a lane that never
//  formed one, sharing `ensureOrCreateNetworkSnapshot`'s body with `formNetworkSnapshot` and
//  stamping committed immediately on creation. (2) R7: `createNetworkSnapshot`'s broadcast pick is
//  now a uniform-random draw (`@Dependency(\.migrationRandomness)`) over the other provider's
//  shipped endpoints, replacing `evaluateBestOf` entirely — creation now makes zero network calls.
//  (3) R8: custom-server detection is identity-based only — the stored `ServerConfig.isCustom` flag
//  is no longer read here. (4) R1: `MigrationGateStorage.isTorEnabledForMigration()`'s never-
//  written default flips from `false` to `true`; the identity-custom forced-false (R2's data half)
//  still wins over either the default or an explicit stored choice.
//
//  MOB-1497 (R7 adversarial-review fix, Important-1): `ensureOrCreateNetworkSnapshot` used to return
//  ANY existing snapshot before creating, regardless of committed/provisional state — so a stale
//  PROVISIONAL snapshot left behind by an abandoned attempt (app killed before commit, or a
//  same-session back-and-reconfirm) would silently win over a fresh Tor choice made at a later
//  attempt's Tor-choice step, in the worst case broadcasting over clearnet under a screen that showed
//  Tor ON. Fixed with a `reformIfProvisional` flag threaded through `ensureOrCreateNetworkSnapshot`:
//  `true` for `formNetworkSnapshot` (a still-provisional existing snapshot is discarded and re-formed
//  from the current stored choice plus a fresh random roll — always safe, since nothing has broadcast
//  against an uncommitted snapshot), `false` for `ensureNetworkSnapshot` (the broadcast-time safety
//  net stays strictly idempotent against a provisional snapshot too, so R7's "held for the run" isn't
//  broken for a mid-run/BG-executor caller). A COMMITTED existing snapshot is never reformed by
//  either path.
//
//  MOB-1497 (R9-T6, finding 8): `ensureOrCreateNetworkSnapshot`'s create path no longer takes
//  `transactionGuard` — the app-wide FIFO mutex shared with `createProposedTransactions`/
//  `createTransactionFromPCZT`/`getTreeState`/vote submission/server switches. Forming was queueing
//  behind whatever ELSE happened to be broadcasting (another account's Tor bootstrap + submit, for
//  one) for no reason: forming never touches the live synchronizer. Its reads/writes are
//  `zcashSDKEnvironment.endpoint()` (UserDefaults-backed), the migration gate's Tor flag
//  (UserDefaults, self-locked), `migrationRandomness.randomIndex` (pure), and `snapshotStorage`
//  (every call atomic under its own `OSAllocatedUnfairLock`) — the hazard the guard exists for
//  (`switchTo(endpoint:)` tearing down the synchronizer under an in-flight broadcast) cannot reach
//  any of that. The routing layer's own snapshot mutations (`rotateBroadcastEndpoint`,
//  `overrideUseTorOnActiveSnapshot`, `overrideBroadcastEndpointToSyncServerOnActiveSnapshot`) were
//  already guard-free by this same reasoning — forming was the odd one out. `MigrationManagerImpl`
//  no longer holds a `transactionGuard` dependency at all.
//
//  The ONE thing the guard incidentally provided — closing the "check absent -> create -> write"
//  race between two concurrent formers for the SAME account — is re-closed at the storage layer:
//  `MigrationSnapshotStorage.ensureOrCreate(candidate:reformIfProvisional:for:)` folds the decide-
//  and-write into ONE `PerAccountCodableStorage.modify` closure. The caller computes the candidate
//  snapshot (the only `await`s — endpoint/Tor-flag/random-pick reads) BEFORE calling in, since
//  `modify`'s closure is synchronous; `ensureOrCreate` then re-checks the SAME reuse condition
//  (`existing.committedAt != nil || !reformIfProvisional`) against whatever is ACTUALLY persisted
//  at the instant its lock is held — a competing former's already-written value wins if it
//  satisfies the condition, this call's candidate otherwise — and returns whichever one is now
//  actually stored. Every caller therefore gets back a value consistent with storage, never a
//  value a concurrent write has already superseded.
//
//  MOB-1497 (T5) — DELETED (audit 2026-08-03, #16): the "pending background Tor prompt" latch
//  is gone. Its named arm site (`RootInitialization.executeBroadcastAction`) never existed and its
//  sheet was never presented, so it could neither be set nor consumed; `markHadBroadcast`/`clear`
//  still remove any value an older build persisted under its key.

            // Two things were wrong with that fall-through, and both matter to a user. It CHURNED —
            // "Migration Progress · We'll notify you when to send" replaced by "Migration Progress ·
            // Keep Zodl open" and back, on a timescale nobody can read. And the idle copy was a
            // false promise: `splitPendingConfirmation` means the preparations have not all mined,
            // so there is nothing to SEND yet and no send to notify about.
            //
            // RESOLVED with the two DESIGNED states and nothing invented. The first attempt gave
            // `.preparing` an `isWorkingNow` flag and a new "Preparing your balance…" line for the
            // waiting half — copy that exists nowhere in Figma, under a spinner that stayed lit
            // while the timeline showed none. Both were reported within the hour, and both were
            // fair: undesigned copy is not ours to mint, and a banner spinner over a spinner-less
            // list is the same contradiction this pass exists to remove, relocated.
            //
            // The churn it was smoothing was also smaller than feared. The field dwell times were
            // 78 s and 12 s — neither close to a flicker. The complaint that DID hold up was
            // latency (18 s blocked reads while the prove sweep held the database), which no banner
            // copy can fix.
            //
            // So: `.preparing` (Figma 5139:35270, spinner + keep-open) while the app can genuinely
            // prove or submit, and the designed idle banner otherwise. The split phase having no
            // designed "waiting" state of its own is a real gap — one for the designers, recorded
            // in SMART_BANNER_STATES §8, not one to paper over here.

            // the banner span a spinner and demanded the user stay for a 5.7 s headless submit,
            // while the timeline one tap away showed no spinner at all: the rows are `ready`, then

            //
            // Sending a split broadcast to the idle `.inProgress` banner made the app SAY NOTHING IS
            // HAPPENING while it had a transaction open on the wire. Field log, the session a user

            //
            // Their tap put the note-split on the network — the transaction the entire schedule
            // depends on — and the app told them there was nothing to do. "Why did I need to open
            // Zodl? This open feels wasted." It was the single most consequential 7 seconds of the
            // run.
            //
            // What was ACTUALLY wrong the first time was not the spinner; it was that the spinner had
            // no counterpart. The complaint was "a spinner on a banner didn't also have any

    // may perform — see `MigrationManagerClient.overrideTorForRun`/`.overrideBroadcastEndpointTo
    // SyncServer` and `MigrationManagerImpl.routeBroadcastFailure`'s own doc for each requirement.

    // no-op + `LoggerProxy.warn` when there is nothing to mutate), but UNLIKE it these apply to the
    // account's ACTIVE snapshot — the COMMITTED one if present, else the still-PROVISIONAL one —
    // rather than only ever a provisional one. (Rebased onto R8-T3: replace-with-copy now spells
    // only the four stored fields — the providers are computed off the endpoints.)
    //
    // R7-review fix (Important-1): originally committed-only. That left the live Keystone note-split
