/// overrides this key. `testValue == liveValue` is deliberate for a plain configuration VALUE (no

                // lane held forever behind a sliding deadline (nine `broadcast(id:)` reads over
                // 15+ minutes). Both timed windows have since been deleted as identifiable
                // patterns, so there is no sliding deadline left to outrun. What remains is
                // narrow and still worth doing: `blocked` now means a submission is genuinely in
                // flight, and letting a running engine sync across it is exactly the adjacency
