/// idempotent — once a copy exists it is never replaced — and keeps the first
/// capture, which is the one taken closest to the incident and before any
/// launch checkpointed the WAL.
///

/// the copy already makes recovery possible later, even for users who upgrade
/// long after the round was wiped.
