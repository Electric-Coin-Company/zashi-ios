/// index are created here with real SQLite, corrupted the way the app corrupted
/// them, and then recovered. That keeps the test honest — the bytes it parses
/// were laid out by SQLite, not by us — and keeps binaries out of the repository.
///
/// The corruption reproduces the incident exactly: a round is delegated, the
/// round row is deleted (`bundles` cascading away with it, taking
/// `van_comm_rand`), and a fresh round is rebuilt in its place with newly
/// sampled secrets. Through SQL the original is gone for good. It survives only
/// in superseded write-ahead log frames.
