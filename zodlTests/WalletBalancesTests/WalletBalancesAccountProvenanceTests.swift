//
//  MOB-1862: `WalletBalances.State.balanceUpdated` (a plain `AccountBalance` with no account or
//  request identity) let a balance read for one account answer for whichever account happened to
//  be selected by the time the read landed. A slow `getLocalAccountBalances()` call started for
//  account A, resolving after the user had already switched to account B, would overwrite B's
//  figures with A's -- silently, with no error surfaced anywhere. A second race lived alongside
//  it: two `.updateBalances` dispatches for the SAME account, the earlier one answering after the
//  later one already has, could still let the stale answer win (last-writer-wins on arrival order,
//  not on which request was actually current).
//
//  The fix attributes every `.balanceUpdated` to the account it was read for AND the request that
//  asked for it -- `WalletBalancesStore.swift`'s `.balanceUpdated(AccountBalance, AccountUUID,
//  Int)` and `State.balanceRequestGeneration`. The handler drops anything whose account no longer
//  matches the current selection or whose generation is not the current one. `.updateBalances`
//  also re-derives `spendability` synchronously, before its own read has any chance to land -- a
//  switch to an account with no published balance yet must not go on showing the PREVIOUS
//  account's spendability for however long that read takes.
//
//  Mirrors `WalletBalancesMaskedSpendableTests.swift`'s established pattern for this directory:
//  `TestStore` with `$0.defaultInMemoryStorage = InMemoryStorage()` per test, and the shared
//  `selectedWalletAccount` slot pinned via `state.$selectedWalletAccount.withLock`. The parked-read
//  mechanics reuse `TestSupport/TestSignals.swift`'s `ResumableGate`/`SignalledRecords`, the same
//  event-driven, no-clock primitives `RootTransactionsCoalescingTests.swift` uses to hold a mocked
//  dependency open on a gate and count calls.
//
//  `.serialized`: constructing/driving `WalletBalances.State` touches the process-global
//  `@Shared(.inMemory(.selectedWalletAccount))` key, same precedent as
//  `WalletBalancesMaskedSpendableTests.swift`.
