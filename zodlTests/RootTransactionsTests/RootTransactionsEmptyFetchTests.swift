//
//  RootTransactionsEmptyFetchTests.swift
//  zodlTests
//
//  `.fetchedTransactions` (`RootTransactions.swift`) used to trust every fetch result
//  unconditionally: whenever the freshly fetched array differed from `state.transactions`, it
//  overwrote the shared list, even with an EMPTY array. `getAllTransactions` can legitimately race
//  a reorg/rescan window mid-sync and answer with zero rows for an account that plainly has
//  transactions -- that raced empty answer blanked a list that was correct a moment before, or
//  left it stuck showing placeholders, with nothing to tell it to trust its own kept rows over a
//  transient miss. A parallel gap sat in the failure path: a THROWN `getAllTransactions` only
//  logged, so a list already showing its loading placeholder (freshly invalidated by an account
//  switch, say) never got the completion signal it needed to clear that placeholder, even though
//  the kept rows underneath were perfectly fine.
//
//  Covers both: an empty fetch is now trusted only once the synchronizer itself reports
//  `.upToDate`, or once a list is already invalidated and therefore has nothing correct left to
//  lose; a failed fetch still notifies both lists and re-arms the reconciliation poller from the
//  rows that were kept, exactly as an ignored empty fetch does.
//
//  Mirrors `RootPendingTransactionRefreshTests.swift`'s established pattern: a plain `Store` (not
//  `TestStore`) driven with `LockIsolated` spies, with time-dependent behavior (the 30 s
//  reconciliation poller) run on a `DispatchQueue.test` scheduler injected as `mainQueue`,
//  advanced in small steps interleaved with real-time yields so the poller's effect Task gets a
//  chance to register its sleep on the scheduler before the clock advances past it.
//
//  `.serialized`: constructing/driving `Root.State` touches the process-global
//  `@Shared(.inMemory(.selectedWalletAccount))` / `.inMemory(.transactions)` keys, same precedent
//  as the other Root-level suites in this directory.
