//
//  A sent transaction could stay rendered as "Sending…" forever even though it had long been
//  mined. The transaction list's pending state resolves ONLY by re-reading the SDK database
//  (`minedHeight` flipping non-nil), and every one of its refresh triggers could be lost:
//
//  1. `.observeTransactions` (`RootTransactions.swift`) throttled the RAW synchronizer event
//     stream (`latest: true`) and only then filtered for `foundTransactions`/`minedTransaction`
//     -- an unrelated `.connectionStateChanged`/`.storedUTXOs` landing in the same 200 ms window
//     replaced the transaction event as "latest" and the refresh silently never fired.
//  2. `didEnterBackground` (`RootInitialization.swift`) cancelled the transaction subscriptions,
//     but the foreground `.retryStart` path only re-registered the synchronizer STATE stream --
//     `.observeTransactions` was dispatched exactly once per process, at app start, so after one
//     background/foreground cycle the list refreshed only by chance one-shot fetches.
//  3. Nothing pull-based backstopped a lost push: once an event was dropped, nothing ever re-read
//     the database again. A 30-second reconciliation poller now runs while any transaction is
//     pending and stops when none is.
//
//  Mirrors `RootTransactionsAccountSwitchTests.swift`'s established pattern: a plain `Store`
//  (not `TestStore`) driven with `LockIsolated` spies and polling, with file-scoped private
//  helpers. Time-dependent behavior (throttle windows, the 30 s poller) runs on a
//  `DispatchQueue.test` scheduler injected as `mainQueue`, advanced in small steps interleaved
//  with real-time yields so effect Tasks get to register their sleeps/timers on the scheduler
//  before it advances past them.
//
//  `.serialized`: constructing/driving `Root.State` touches the process-global
//  `@Shared(.inMemory(.selectedWalletAccount))` / `.inMemory(.transactions)` keys, same precedent
//  as the other Root-level suites in this directory.
