//
//  RootTransactionsAccountProvenanceTests.swift
//  zodlTests
//
//  The shared `transactions` array used to carry no record of which account's fetch actually
//  produced it. `accountSwitchedEffect` (`RootCoordinator.swift`) invalidated both transaction
//  lists on a switch but left the array itself untouched, so if the NEWLY selected account's first
//  fetch then FAILED, the failure path's own guard (`accountUUID == state.selectedWalletAccount?.id`)
//  passed -- correctly, the failure genuinely is for the current account -- and went on to notify
//  both lists and re-arm the reconciliation poller from whatever was still sitting in
//  `state.transactions`: the PREVIOUS account's rows. Both lists cleared their loading placeholder
//  and rendered the old account's history as if it were the new account's, with no error surfaced
//  anywhere.
//
//  The fix is two-layered: `accountSwitchedEffect` now empties the shared array (and the new
//  `transactionsAccountId` alongside it) the moment it invalidates both lists, so nothing
//  renderable survives a switch until the new account's own fetch actually lands; and
//  `transactionsAccountId` (`RootStore.swift`) records which account's rows are CURRENTLY in the
//  array, read by both the pre-existing empty-fetch keep-guard and a new defensive check on the
//  failure path, so neither can ever treat a foreign account's leftover rows as a confirmed answer
//  for the account a fetch just completed -- or failed -- for.
//
//  Mirrors `RootTransactionsAccountSwitchTests.swift`'s established pattern: a plain `Store` (not
//  `TestStore`) driven with a file-scoped `baseNoOpDependencies` baseline (copied from that file,
//  since these tests drive the SAME real switch action, `.home(.walletAccountTapped)`, and need the
//  same dependency shape for `loadContacts`/`resolveMetadataEncryptionKeys`/`loadUserMetadata` to
//  settle). Every account's rows are seeded via a REAL `.fetchedTransactions` completion rather than
//  a hand-built `$transactions`/`transactionsAccountId` fixture, so `transactionsAccountId` ends up
//  set exactly the way production sets it. The one late-arriving completion each test needs (a
//  stale failure, or a still-parked fetch for the newly-selected account) is driven with
//  `TestSupport/TestSignals.swift`'s `ResumableGate` -- the same event-driven, no-clock primitive
//  `RootTransactionsCoalescingTests.swift` uses to hold a mocked dependency open on a gate.
//
//  `.serialized`: constructing/driving `Root.State` touches the process-global
//  `@Shared(.inMemory(.selectedWalletAccount))` / `.inMemory(.transactions)` /
//  `.inMemory(.walletAccounts)` / `.inMemory(.unminedMigrationPendingValue)` keys, same precedent
//  as every other Root-level suite in this directory. `.serialized` alone only orders tests WITHIN
//  this suite, though -- every test additionally pins a fresh `InMemoryStorage()` via
//  `withDependencies` (state and store built INSIDE that scope), since otherwise this suite could
//  still interleave with `RootAccountSwitchMigrationPendingResetTests.swift`, which seeds the same
//  `.unminedMigrationPendingValue` slot on the shared process-global default storage.
