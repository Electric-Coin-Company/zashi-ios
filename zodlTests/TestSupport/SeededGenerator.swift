//
//  Reproducible randomness for tests.
//
//  General-purpose: any test that wants bytes which vary per run yet replay
//  exactly when a run fails. Nothing here is tied to a particular suite or
//  feature.
//
//  The pattern it supports:
//
//      let seed = UInt64.random(in: .min ... .max)   // vary per run
//      print("[fixture] seed \(seed)")               // so CI can replay it
//      var rng = SeededGenerator(seed: seed)
//      let byte = UInt8.random(in: 0...255, using: &rng)
//
//  Randomising is what makes the test sample a new arrangement each run, and
//  logging the seed is what stops that costing reproducibility. One without
//  the other is either a fixed sample or an unreproducible failure.
//
