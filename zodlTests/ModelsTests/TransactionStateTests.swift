//
//  Covers `TransactionState.netValue` (Models/TransactionState.swift) for self-transfers - a
//  transaction whose sender and recipient are the same wallet. A self-transfer's SDK-reported
//  `value` (the account's balance delta) is exactly `-fee`: the amount sent out and the amount
//  that returns as change cancel each other out, leaving only the fee behind. `netValue`'s
//  default path (`zecAmount`, which is just `-value` for a sent transaction) therefore already
//  displays the fee correctly, with no special-casing required. There is deliberately no
//  note-count-based (or otherwise conditional) fallback to a larger "amount that actually moved" -
//  none exists, and these tests guard against one being reintroduced. Pure model logic, no
//  shared/global state -> no `.serialized`.
