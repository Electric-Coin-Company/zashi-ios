//  MOB-1749: the residual banner never holds the top-priority migration slot itself (no snooze,
//  no session verdict — it bypasses the checkingStatus machinery entirely). Re-ranked 2026-08-25
//  (approved): it seats at rank 1.75, DIRECTLY BELOW the migration slot — only connectivity and
//  sync-error alerts and a real migration outrank it; the informational rungs (backup, shielding,
//  Tor, currency conversion) rank below it. The suppression trade-off was accepted knowingly —
//  at the old bottom rank a dust wallet could wait behind currency conversion forever.
//
//  PARTLY SUPERSEDED 2026-09-09 by MOB-1786 (approved): wallet backup left the informational
//  rungs and now ranks -1, above everything. The residual keeps 1.75 and keeps outranking
//  shielding, Tor and currency conversion; it no longer outranks backup. Nothing else moved.
