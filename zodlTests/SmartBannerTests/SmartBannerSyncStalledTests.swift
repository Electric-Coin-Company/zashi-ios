//  MOB-1853 — once automatic stall recovery has given up for good this foreground (the
//  terminal-stall rebuild budget spent, a rebuild blocked by the `bgTask`/server-setup guard, or a
//  dispatched rebuild that never actually started a pass), `Root` notifies the SmartBanner via
//  `.syncStalledTerminally(Bool)` (`RootTransactions.swift`'s `markSyncStalledTerminally`/
//  `clearSyncStalledTerminally`), and this lane (`.priorityStalled`, rank 0.75 — directly below
//  `.priority1` lost connection and above `.priority2` sync error) shows an honest "Sync has
//  stalled" banner with a Retry action instead of the SDK's own `.syncing` publishing forever with
//  nothing said about it, and keeps that Retry reachable even while a persistent sync error is
//  also showing. `RootTerminalStallRebuildTests.swift` covers the Root-side wiring that produces
//  the notification; this file covers only the banner lane itself.
//
//  Mirrors `SmartBannerResidualSlotTests.swift`/`SmartBannerShieldingOfferLifecycleTests.swift` for
//  driving `SmartBanner` via `TestStore` with `exhaustivity = .off`, `mainQueue = .immediate`, and
//  an isolated `InMemoryStorage()` per test (`SmartBanner.State` carries `@Shared(.inMemory(...))`
//  process-global storage).
