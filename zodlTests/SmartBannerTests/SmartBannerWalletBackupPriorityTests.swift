//
//  MOB-1786 (approved 2026-09-09): a wallet that has received funds while its seed is still
//  unbacked shows the backup prompt ahead of every other banner. Three users lost funds because
//  the rung sat at 6 — bottom half of the ladder — and the walk short-circuits at the first
//  match, so migration or an error state holding the seat meant the prompt was never even asked.
//
//  Two things had to change together and this suite pins both: the rung is now asked FIRST
//  (straight after the ladder's account guard, as `.evaluatePriorityWalletBackup`), and it seats
//  at rank -1 so it also wins in the displacement direction. Changing only one leaves the other
//  ordering wrong.
//
//  What did NOT change: the gates. A new wallet cannot spend, so any transaction is a receive —
//  which is why `transactions.isEmpty` is the "has received funds" test, and why spending back
//  down to zero must not retract the prompt. The keychain's `hasUserPassedPhraseBackupTest` ends
//  it for good, and the user's own "Remind me later" is still honoured (reminder cadence belongs
//  to PRO-276).
