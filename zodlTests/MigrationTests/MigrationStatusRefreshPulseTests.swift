//  MOB-1466 — the status screen's 30s REFRESH PULSE. Field-caught 2026-08-02: with the foreground
//  tick loop running, the Migration Progress screen sat frozen while OPEN and only showed fresh
//  rows after closing and reopening. The event-driven refresh chain is real but narrower than the
//  screen's truth: ETA captions age with the wall clock, and no DB write announces the passage of
//  time — so something must ask on a cadence while the screen is up.
//
//  R13 Brick 2 changed WHAT the pulse does, not whether it exists: it no longer runs a private
//  `loadStatus` query — it asks THE pipeline to re-derive (`refreshMigrationSnapshot`), and the
//  fresh value arrives on the screen's one snapshot subscription like every other update. The
//  channel's value-equality dedupe keeps quiet ticks off the screen. These tests pin the CADENCE
//  and LIFECYCLE (fires every 30s while up, stops on disappear, never before appear, survives the
//  tick loop's off switch); the spy counts `refreshMigrationSnapshot` — the pulse's only remaining
//  effect, also called exactly once by `onAppear`'s own R3 re-verify kick, which is the `== 1`
//  baseline every test starts from.
