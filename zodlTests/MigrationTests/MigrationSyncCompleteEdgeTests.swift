//  MigrationSyncCompleteEdgeTests.swift
//  zodlTests
//
//  The sync-complete edge must run the migration sweeps on a wallet that HAS an account.
//
//  Field-caught 2026-07-31, and the most consequential defect of the session. `Root`'s
//  `.synchronizerStateChanged` case built `migrationReconcileEffect` on the edge into `.upToDate` —
//  prove sweep, reconcile, notification arming — and then returned it from
//  exactly ONE path:
//
//      guard let account = state.selectedWalletAccount else {
//          return migrationReconcileEffect     // the ONLY return that carried it
//      }
//
//  Every later `return` in that case discarded it. So the entire migration edge ran only when NO
//  account was selected — precisely the case with nothing to migrate — and never on a real wallet.
//
//  What that looked like on a device: the engine asked to prove preparation (0,0) at every open,
//  forever; nothing proved it, so nothing was ever broadcast; a committed run sat at 0-of-12 with
//  all four preparations reading "Ready now". A migration that could not take its first step.
//
//  Note what this did NOT look like: an error. No throw, no failed call, no red anything. An effect
//  was constructed and dropped, which is invisible from every angle except the absence of work.
//  Giving the sweeps their callers (board A24/A28) was necessary and not sufficient — the callers
//  existed and their effect was thrown away one line later.
//
//  So the tests below assert the sweeps RUN, on the path that matters (an account IS selected), and
//  do not assert anything about what they return. Reaching them was the whole bug.
//
//  MOB-1466 (2026-08-02): the edge no longer hand-sequences prove-sweep/reconcile/re-arm. It calls
//  `migrationManager.advance(.afterSync)`, which asks the engine what the run needs and discharges
//  exactly that — the prove sweep is what it does when the answer is `.prove`, which on a healthy
//  run at the tip it usually is. These tests moved to that seam with their claims intact, and gained
//  one: the PHASE is now pinned too. `.afterSync` at this edge is a privacy property, not a detail —
//  it is the only phase allowed to prove, and the one forbidden from broadcasting, because this
//  session has already been on the wire.
