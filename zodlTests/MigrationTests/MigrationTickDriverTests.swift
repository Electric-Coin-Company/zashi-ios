//  MigrationTickDriverTests.swift
//  zodlTests
//
//  MOB-1466 — the `.tick` phase's DRIVER-side mechanics, exercised against a real
//  `MigrationManagerImpl` with a stubbed SDK rather than the pure decision table
//  (`MigrationStepPlanTests` already pins that a tick's `.broadcast` column matches `.beforeSync`'s).
//  Three properties live only here, in the executor:
//
//   - THE MODE BELT. A tick may broadcast for a `.privateScheduled` run and must not for an
//     `.immediate` one — `.immediate` still gets its one delivery from the open lanes, and ticking
//     it too would send the moment Ironwood activates rather than at the user's chosen pace.
//   - THE SINGLE-FLIGHT LATCH. A `.tick` arriving while another `advance` is in flight must yield
//     (`.skipped`) WITHOUT touching the engine — ticks fire every 30s and must never queue up behind
//     a slower `.beforeSync`/`.afterSync` call, or behind each other. A `.beforeSync`/`.afterSync`
//     caller, by contrast, always waits its turn and runs — an app-open's own driver call must never
//     be silently dropped for arriving mid-tick.
//   - THE PRIVACY-BUFFER FAST PATH. A tick that arrives while the buffer holds must say so cheaply,
//     without spending a per-account engine read to learn what the buffer already knew.
//
//  Arming hygiene (quiet ticks must not re-arm notifications) is pinned here too, at the driver
//  level, per this feature's own spec — arming is `advance`'s business, not Root's.
