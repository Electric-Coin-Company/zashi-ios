//
//  "Ready now" is not a phase (MOB-1466, Lukas's ruling 2026-08-08).
//
//  THE FIELD REPORT. Lukas opened Zodl after several hours away and found "Ready now" on most of
//  his transfers. The cause was arithmetic, not design: `MigrationChainClock.secondsUntil` returns
//  zero for any height at or behind the tip, `MigrationETA.minutesFromNow` clamps at zero on top of
//  it, and `bucketed` reads `<= 0` as `.readyNow`. A height three hours in the past and one due
//  this second produce the identical `0`. Sleep through part of a schedule and every passed row
//  claims to be actionable.
//
//  It was wrong twice over. Wrong about TIME, because those windows had passed rather than
//  arrived. And wrong about ACTIONABILITY, because ZIP 318 permits one broadcast at a time — the
//  derivation itself only ever makes ONE row the acted-on one (`nonSentRowStatus`'s
//  `guard isFirstNonSent`) — so all but one of those invitations is refused by the engine.
//
//  Checking the frames settled it: "Ready now" appears in no post-commit screen, only the `.replan`
//  and expiry flows. Lukas's statement of the real ladder: a prepared transfer says "~X", a passed
//  one is overdue, "there is no phase at all saying ready now".
//
//  WHY "Recomputing ETA…" IS THE TRUE WORD and not merely a softer one. The engine's overdue
//  re-spread ("at most one overdue transfer is released immediately; the rest are re-spread")
//  raises EVERY pending scheduled height by the lag, judged at the ESTIMATED target so it runs
//  before the wallet syncs (`zcash_pool_migration`, satisfiability.rs). So on the very next
//  `advance_migration` these rows really do get new times. The label states the gap between opening
//  the app and that shift landing — a real interval with a real end.
//
//  THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it is the reason `migrationPlan.readyNow` still exists. The re-spread
//  deliberately excludes an ANCHOR-GATED transfer: re-spreading on one "would shift the whole plan
//  … every time the gate was waited out, chasing its own tail". Nothing will ever recompute that
//  row's height, so "Recomputing ETA…" there would be this same bug pointing the other way. Lukas
//  ruled the fallback rather than new copy — "keep it as 'ready now' (= unblocking you with
//  fallback value rather than some new one)" — so the string survives with exactly one caller.
