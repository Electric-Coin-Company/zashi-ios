//
//  Q2-1 (read-only SDK reads): the snapshot pipeline no longer serves stale caches or drops
//  rebuild requests while migration work is in flight — reads are cheap now, so every request
//  builds. These pin the three behaviors the cache retirement changes.
//
//  Fixture conventions mirror the retired warm-up suite's idiom (fixed-bytes AccountUUID, the tip/
//  activation-height pair, `withDependencies`) and MigrationSentRecordAttributionTests (the
//  committed-schedule builder, a named `UserDefaults` suite for `MigrationScheduleStorage`).
//  Serialized: installs the same wallet-wide candidate account set
//  (`@Shared(.inMemory(.selectedWalletAccount))` / `.walletAccounts`) those suites serialize their
//  own runs over.
//
//  A concurrently-running derivation (the coalesced republish `Task` `refreshMigrationSnapshot`
//  fires) is awaited event-driven, never polled:
//  `firstSnapshot(of:matching:storingIn:afterSubscribing:)` bridges Combine's `first(where:)` to a
//  continuation for "a specific published snapshot landed", and
//  `MigrationManagerImpl.awaitSnapshotRepublishIdle(for:)` (a test-support hook, its awaitable
//  sibling to the synchronous `isSnapshotRepublishIdle(for:)`) is suspended on directly for "the
//  coalescer went idle". An earlier version polled both against a wall-clock deadline (`waitUntil`,
//  10 s) — correct in kind (a real condition, not a blind sleep) but still a fixed budget racing
//  work whose actual duration scales with CI load, so a busier-than-tested runner could always
//  make the deadline lose even though nothing was wrong.
//
//  `lockingRepublishesTheSnapshotBeforeReturning` crosses a writer edge whose awaited republish
//  `lockMigrationDust` wraps in the `lockRepublishTimeoutNanoseconds` bound (`awaitBounded`,
//  production default 10 s in MigrationManagerLiveKey.swift) — past it the lock returns early by
//  design (its documented heal path) and the final `#expect(published.banner == nil)` would see
//  the stale residual. The sweep sibling hit exactly that race under CI starvation (unit_tests run
//  33495197340, `recordTransferBroadcast`'s twin of this bound), so this test now constructs its
//  manager with the bound raised past `.timeLimit` through the init seam: the limit records a
//  genuinely wedged build, and load alone can no longer expire the lock's awaited republish.
//
//  `.timeLimit` is also not a hang-preventer: both new awaits above are plain
//  `withCheckedContinuation`s with no cancellation handler, so a coalescer that genuinely never
//  goes idle leaves the suspended `Task` running regardless of the trait. What `.timeLimit` does is
//  RECORD the test as failed at 60 s instead of the run showing it as still in progress forever —
//  an actual hang is bounded only by the CI job's own timeout, outside this file's control.
