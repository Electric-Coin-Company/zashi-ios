//  MigrationBannerEntryTests.swift

//
//  Scenario 1.1 as a unit test: a restored wallet with Orchard funds and NO migration run must be
//  OFFERED the migration.
//
//  This exists because 778 passing tests did not catch the feature's entry point being dead. Every
//  pure piece was correct and independently tested — `MigrationState.derive` mapped a nil advance
//  step to `.notStarted`, `MigrationDerivations.bannerVariant` mapped `.notStarted` + a positive
//  Orchard balance to `.required` — and the LIVE GLUE between them threw the nil away:
//
//      guard let advanceStep = try? await sdkSynchronizer.migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID)
//      else { return nil }   // "the read failed"
//
//  `migrationAdvanceStep` returns `MigrationAdvanceStep?`, and since SE-0230 `try?` FLATTENS a
//  throwing optional call into ONE optional — so "threw" and "no run" arrive as the same `nil` and
//  that guard treats a healthy no-run wallet as a failed read. `bannerVariant` returned nil forever,
//  no banner ever appeared, and since the banner is how a run is STARTED, the feature could not be
//  entered at all. The tests stayed green because they call the pure functions directly, passing the
//  optional themselves — the only caller that ever exercised `derive`'s documented nil arm.
//
//  So this test drives the REAL `MigrationManagerImpl` with mocked dependencies rather than the pure
//  layer, because the pure layer was never wrong. A test that cannot fail on the bug it is named for
//  is decoration.
