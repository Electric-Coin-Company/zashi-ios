//
//  `.initialization(.initializeSDK)` runs `sdkSynchronizer.prepareWith` in an effect, and
//  the SDK reports an unprepared status until `prepare` fully returns, so
//  `.appDelegate(.willEnterForeground)` re-enters
//  `.initialSetups → .checkWalletInitialization → .initializeSDK` while a first prepare is
//  still in flight. The `isInitializingSDK` latch makes the first prepare win and drops
//  re-entries until the in-flight effect signals completion. This test holds the first
//  `prepareWith` open on a gate, fires the foreground re-entry, and asserts no second
//  `prepareWith` is dispatched.
