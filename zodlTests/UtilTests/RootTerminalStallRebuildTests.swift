//
//  MOB-1853 — once the SDK's own stall recovery gives up (`.syncStalled(gaveUp: true)`), a
//  benchmark-only refresh (`.refreshAutomaticServer`) is not enough: manual mode has no candidate to
//  offer, and even Automatic mode's ordinary switch is a no-op when the winning candidate is the
//  server already configured. `RootTransactions.swift`'s `.syncStalled` handler instead calls
//  `autoServerSelection.rebuildAfterStall()` — which always restarts at SOMETHING, the current
//  endpoint included — at most `Root.State.maxTerminalStallRebuildsPerForeground` (2) times per
//  foreground, so a wallet that cannot be revived this way settles on the SDK's own visible error
//  state instead of retrying forever. See `AutoServerSelectionRebuildTests.swift` for the dependency
//  itself; this file covers only the bounding/wiring done in `Root`.
//
//  Mirrors `RootAutoServerIdleGateTests.swift`'s fixtures and `makeStore` shape (that file keeps the
//  still-unchanged benchmark-only path for `attempt >= 2, gaveUp: false`, plus a regression proving
//  `rebuildAfterStall` stays untouched by it).
//
//  Also covers `Root.State.isTerminalStallRebuildInFlight`: a benchmark dispatched by an earlier
//  `.refreshAutomaticServer` (attempt 2, before the give-up) can still be running when a later
//  give-up starts the rebuild. The terminal branch cancels that benchmark's own effect
//  (`automaticServerRefreshCancelId`), which is normally enough on its own -- TCA's `Send` already
//  refuses to deliver an action once its effect's Task is cancelled (`Effect.swift`'s
//  `Send.callAsFunction`) -- but leaves a residual window a genuine data race between two
//  concurrently-running effects could still hit (the cancellation flag and the delivery are not one
//  atomic step). `isTerminalStallRebuildInFlight` is the belt-and-suspenders for that window: the
//  test below drives it directly, by sending `.autoServerCandidateReady` while a rebuild is in
//  flight, rather than by racing a real cancelled effect -- a deterministically SEQUENCED test can
//  never observe that race (the cancel always happens-before the delivery attempt, so `Send` always
//  wins), only a genuinely concurrent one could, and that is not this framework's job to reproduce.
//  Placed here rather than in `RootAutoServerIdleGateTests.swift` since it is a property of the
//  REBUILD's own in-flight window, the same thing every other test in this file drives.
