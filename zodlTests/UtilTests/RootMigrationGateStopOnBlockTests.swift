//  MOB-1466 — the STOP half of Root's migration sync-gate pair, field-caught 2026-08-02
//  (evening log): with the app foregrounded and the tick loop running, a proved, due transfer
//  sat unbroadcast for 15+ minutes. The engine answered `broadcast(id:)` on every read; every
//  tick was `held(privacy buffer until …)` with a deadline that slid forward forever, because
//  the app-side send window re-armed faster than it could expire — the foreground sync completed
//  every ~2.5 minutes throughout.
//
//  FIRST CUT (superseded, kept for history): stopped a running sync through
//  `stopSyncBeforeMigrationBroadcast()`, guarded by `isSyncing()`. The WHOLE-BRANCH review caught
//  that this guard is false in exactly the wedge state it exists to fix — the engine the field log
//  describes sits at `.upToDate` BETWEEN blocks, not mid-scan.
//
//  SECOND CUT (superseded by this file's current content, kept for history): pinned
//  `stopStartedSyncForMigrationGate()` (the "started", not "syncing", sibling) plus wallet-wide
//  candidate scoping and the tick-loop-off-switch gate — but stopped UNCONDITIONALLY once any
//  candidate was eligible. Two further holes, caught by the second whole-branch review: (1)
//  ATTRIBUTION — the SDK's gate is wallet-wide, so with two eligible candidates where only a
//  manual-delivery account's ready broadcast is what tripped it, the unconditional stop could
//  still pause the OTHER eligible candidate for a broadcast nothing automatic would ever send; (2)
//  LIVENESS — the tick loop spawns only at app-open and self-cancels on a terminal verdict, so a
//  run COMMITTED mid-session (mid-foreground, via the migration flow, or via a tick's own
//  `.rebuilt`/`.proved` verdict) could leave the stop with no lane left to consume the silence it
//  bought, stranding sync for the rest of the foreground instead of freeing it.
//
//  THIS suite now pins the PROBE (`sdkSynchronizer.migrationAdvanceStep`, per candidate — the
//  attribution the wallet-wide gate itself lacks; stops only once a tick-deliverable candidate's
//  own step answers `.broadcast`, retrying through the estimated-vs-scanned tip skew and otherwise
//  leaving sync running) and the two LIVENESS ensures (the blocked edge's merged
//  `migrationTickLoopEffect` re-spawn, and `.migrationCoordFlow(.flowFinished)`'s identical
//  re-spawn). The RESUME half of the pair (`.migrationSyncGateChanged(false)` -> `.retryStart`) is
//  unchanged and untouched here — see `RootMigrationGateRefusalTests`/`RootMigrationTickLoopTests`
//  for its coverage.
//
//  FIX ROUND 1 (whole-branch review of the above): two gaps in the probe itself, both closed here.
//  (a) CANCELLATION RACE — `.cancel(id:)` only sets the probe Task's cancelled flag; it cannot
//  abort a `migrationAdvanceStep` await already in flight, so a step read that lands `.broadcast`
//  after the false edge already cancelled the probe (and resume already restarted sync) used to
//  stop that just-resumed sync anyway. Pinned by `stepReadLandingAfterTheFalseEdgeMustNotStop`,
//  which holds the read open on a continuation for a deterministic interleaving. (b) COVERAGE —
//  `aCandidateAccountEligibilityIsWalletWide` (the two-candidate wallet-wide attribution shape)
//  was dropped when this suite was reworked around the probe; restored here against the probe's
//  own per-candidate loop rather than the old unconditional stop.
//
//  `extension Root.State: @retroactive Equatable` already exists module-wide at
//  RootInitializeSDKHealTests.swift — this file uses it rather than redeclaring (see
//  RootMigrationGateRefusalTests's header for the duplicate-conformance rationale).
