/// The `WalletStorageClient` is a wrapper around the `WalletStorage` type that allows for easy testing.
/// The `WalletStorage` Type is comprised of static functions that take and produce data.  In order
/// to easily produce test data, all of these static functions have been wrapped in function
/// properties that live on the `WalletStorageClient` type.  Because of this, you can instantiate
/// the `WalletStorageClient` with your own implementation of these functions for testing purposes,
/// or you can use one of the built in static versions of the `WalletStorageClient`.
