# Check that every tagged release/ branch has been merged back into its
# maintenance line, and forward down to main.
#
# Usage: check-release-merged-back.sh [pr-base] [pr-ref]
#
#   pr-base   branch a pending change targets; that branch is then evaluated
#             as it would be with the change applied. Omit to check the
#             branches as they stand.
#   pr-ref    the pending change; defaults to HEAD (refs/pull/N/merge in CI).
#
# A release/X.Y.Z branch counts as released once a release-shaped tag (X.Y.Z)
# not older than the version in the branch name is reachable from its tip --
# reachable, not at the tip, so commits landing after the tag do not unmark
# the branch. A branch prepare-release.sh has freshly cut reaches only the
# PREVIOUS release's tag, so it is skipped as in-flight until its own tag
# lands. A release/ branch with no version in its name is released only while
# a release tag points at its tip. The maintenance line comes from the tag
# rather than the branch name and is always maint/vX.Y.x -- the shape the
# release tooling names; a maint/ branch of any other shape is reported and
# ignored.
#
# Branches resolve under refs/remotes/$REMOTE, which defaults to origin -- what
# CI checks out. Set REMOTE to run this against a local clone whose canonical
# remote has another name, and run `git fetch` first.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every checked branch is merged back; 1 = advisory findings
# (a tagged release missing from a branch it should be in); 2 = the check
# could not run at all -- refs unreadable, git failing -- which callers must
# not report as a clean result.
